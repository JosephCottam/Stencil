39, CHAPTER
39, I.
39, Down
39, the
39, Rabbit-Hole
40, 
41, Alice
41, was
41, beginning
41, to
41, get
41, very
41, tired
41, of
41, sitting
41, by
41, her
41, sister
41, on
41, the
42, bank,
42, and
42, of
42, having
42, nothing
42, to
42, do:
42, once
42, or
42, twice
42, she
42, had
42, peeped
42, into
42, the
43, book
43, her
43, sister
43, was
43, reading,
43, but
43, it
43, had
43, no
43, pictures
43, or
43, conversations
43, in
44, it,
44, 'and
44, what
44, is
44, the
44, use
44, of
44, a
44, book,'
44, thought
44, Alice
44, 'without
44, pictures
44, or
45, conversation?'
46, 
47, So
47, she
47, was
47, considering
47, in
47, her
47, own
47, mind
47, (as
47, well
47, as
47, she
47, could,
47, for
47, the
48, hot
48, day
48, made
48, her
48, feel
48, very
48, sleepy
48, and
48, stupid),
48, whether
48, the
48, pleasure
49, of
49, making
49, a
49, daisy-chain
49, would
49, be
49, worth
49, the
49, trouble
49, of
49, getting
49, up
49, and
50, picking
50, the
50, daisies,
50, when
50, suddenly
50, a
50, White
50, Rabbit
50, with
50, pink
50, eyes
50, ran
51, close
51, by
51, her.
52, 
53, There
53, was
53, nothing
53, so
53, VERY
53, remarkable
53, in
53, that;
53, nor
53, did
53, Alice
53, think
53, it
53, so
54, VERY
54, much
54, out
54, of
54, the
54, way
54, to
54, hear
54, the
54, Rabbit
54, say
54, to
54, itself,
54, 'Oh
54, dear!
55, Oh
55, dear!
55, I
55, shall
55, be
55, late!'
55, (when
55, she
55, thought
55, it
55, over
55, afterwards,
55, it
56, occurred
56, to
56, her
56, that
56, she
56, ought
56, to
56, have
56, wondered
56, at
56, this,
56, but
56, at
56, the
56, time
57, it
57, all
57, seemed
57, quite
57, natural);
57, but
57, when
57, the
57, Rabbit
57, actually
57, TOOK
57, A
57, WATCH
58, OUT
58, OF
58, ITS
58, WAISTCOAT-POCKET,
58, and
58, looked
58, at
58, it,
58, and
58, then
58, hurried
58, on,
59, Alice
59, started
59, to
59, her
59, feet,
59, for
59, it
59, flashed
59, across
59, her
59, mind
59, that
59, she
59, had
60, never
60, before
60, seen
60, a
60, rabbit
60, with
60, either
60, a
60, waistcoat-pocket,
60, or
60, a
60, watch
61, to
61, take
61, out
61, of
61, it,
61, and
61, burning
61, with
61, curiosity,
61, she
61, ran
61, across
61, the
61, field
62, after
62, it,
62, and
62, fortunately
62, was
62, just
62, in
62, time
62, to
62, see
62, it
62, pop
62, down
62, a
62, large
63, rabbit-hole
63, under
63, the
63, hedge.
64, 
65, In
65, another
65, moment
65, down
65, went
65, Alice
65, after
65, it,
65, never
65, once
65, considering
65, how
66, in
66, the
66, world
66, she
66, was
66, to
66, get
66, out
66, again.
67, 
68, The
68, rabbit-hole
68, went
68, straight
68, on
68, like
68, a
68, tunnel
68, for
68, some
68, way,
68, and
68, then
69, dipped
69, suddenly
69, down,
69, so
69, suddenly
69, that
69, Alice
69, had
69, not
69, a
69, moment
69, to
69, think
70, about
70, stopping
70, herself
70, before
70, she
70, found
70, herself
70, falling
70, down
70, a
70, very
70, deep
71, well.
72, 
73, Either
73, the
73, well
73, was
73, very
73, deep,
73, or
73, she
73, fell
73, very
73, slowly,
73, for
73, she
73, had
74, plenty
74, of
74, time
74, as
74, she
74, went
74, down
74, to
74, look
74, about
74, her
74, and
74, to
74, wonder
74, what
74, was
75, going
75, to
75, happen
75, next.
75, First,
75, she
75, tried
75, to
75, look
75, down
75, and
75, make
75, out
75, what
76, she
76, was
76, coming
76, to,
76, but
76, it
76, was
76, too
76, dark
76, to
76, see
76, anything;
76, then
76, she
77, looked
77, at
77, the
77, sides
77, of
77, the
77, well,
77, and
77, noticed
77, that
77, they
77, were
77, filled
77, with
78, cupboards
78, and
78, book-shelves;
78, here
78, and
78, there
78, she
78, saw
78, maps
78, and
78, pictures
79, hung
79, upon
79, pegs.
79, She
79, took
79, down
79, a
79, jar
79, from
79, one
79, of
79, the
79, shelves
79, as
80, she
80, passed;
80, it
80, was
80, labelled
80, 'ORANGE
80, MARMALADE',
80, but
80, to
80, her
80, great
81, disappointment
81, it
81, was
81, empty:
81, she
81, did
81, not
81, like
81, to
81, drop
81, the
81, jar
81, for
81, fear
82, of
82, killing
82, somebody,
82, so
82, managed
82, to
82, put
82, it
82, into
82, one
82, of
82, the
82, cupboards
82, as
83, she
83, fell
83, past
83, it.
84, 
85, 'Well!'
85, thought
85, Alice
85, to
85, herself,
85, 'after
85, such
85, a
85, fall
85, as
85, this,
85, I
85, shall
86, think
86, nothing
86, of
86, tumbling
86, down
86, stairs!
86, How
86, brave
86, they'll
86, all
86, think
86, me
86, at
87, home!
87, Why,
87, I
87, wouldn't
87, say
87, anything
87, about
87, it,
87, even
87, if
87, I
87, fell
87, off
87, the
87, top
88, of
88, the
88, house!'
88, (Which
88, was
88, very
88, likely
88, true.)
89, 
90, Down,
90, down,
90, down.
90, Would
90, the
90, fall
90, NEVER
90, come
90, to
90, an
90, end!
90, 'I
90, wonder
90, how
91, many
91, miles
91, I've
91, fallen
91, by
91, this
91, time?'
91, she
91, said
91, aloud.
91, 'I
91, must
91, be
91, getting
92, somewhere
92, near
92, the
92, centre
92, of
92, the
92, earth.
92, Let
92, me
92, see:
92, that
92, would
92, be
92, four
93, thousand
93, miles
93, down,
93, I
93, think--'
93, (for,
93, you
93, see,
93, Alice
93, had
93, learnt
93, several
94, things
94, of
94, this
94, sort
94, in
94, her
94, lessons
94, in
94, the
94, schoolroom,
94, and
94, though
94, this
95, was
95, not
95, a
95, VERY
95, good
95, opportunity
95, for
95, showing
95, off
95, her
95, knowledge,
95, as
95, there
96, was
96, no
96, one
96, to
96, listen
96, to
96, her,
96, still
96, it
96, was
96, good
96, practice
96, to
96, say
96, it
96, over)
97, '--yes,
97, that's
97, about
97, the
97, right
97, distance--but
97, then
97, I
97, wonder
97, what
97, Latitude
98, or
98, Longitude
98, I've
98, got
98, to?'
98, (Alice
98, had
98, no
98, idea
98, what
98, Latitude
98, was,
98, or
99, Longitude
99, either,
99, but
99, thought
99, they
99, were
99, nice
99, grand
99, words
99, to
99, say.)
100, 
101, Presently
101, she
101, began
101, again.
101, 'I
101, wonder
101, if
101, I
101, shall
101, fall
101, right
101, THROUGH
101, the
102, earth!
102, How
102, funny
102, it'll
102, seem
102, to
102, come
102, out
102, among
102, the
102, people
102, that
102, walk
102, with
103, their
103, heads
103, downward!
103, The
103, Antipathies,
103, I
103, think--'
103, (she
103, was
103, rather
103, glad
104, there
104, WAS
104, no
104, one
104, listening,
104, this
104, time,
104, as
104, it
104, didn't
104, sound
104, at
104, all
104, the
105, right
105, word)
105, '--but
105, I
105, shall
105, have
105, to
105, ask
105, them
105, what
105, the
105, name
105, of
105, the
105, country
106, is,
106, you
106, know.
106, Please,
106, Ma'am,
106, is
106, this
106, New
106, Zealand
106, or
106, Australia?'
106, (and
107, she
107, tried
107, to
107, curtsey
107, as
107, she
107, spoke--fancy
107, CURTSEYING
107, as
107, you're
107, falling
108, through
108, the
108, air!
108, Do
108, you
108, think
108, you
108, could
108, manage
108, it?)
108, 'And
108, what
108, an
109, ignorant
109, little
109, girl
109, she'll
109, think
109, me
109, for
109, asking!
109, No,
109, it'll
109, never
109, do
109, to
110, ask:
110, perhaps
110, I
110, shall
110, see
110, it
110, written
110, up
110, somewhere.'
111, 
112, Down,
112, down,
112, down.
112, There
112, was
112, nothing
112, else
112, to
112, do,
112, so
112, Alice
112, soon
112, began
113, talking
113, again.
113, 'Dinah'll
113, miss
113, me
113, very
113, much
113, to-night,
113, I
113, should
113, think!'
114, (Dinah
114, was
114, the
114, cat.)
114, 'I
114, hope
114, they'll
114, remember
114, her
114, saucer
114, of
114, milk
114, at
115, tea-time.
115, Dinah
115, my
115, dear!
115, I
115, wish
115, you
115, were
115, down
115, here
115, with
115, me!
115, There
115, are
115, no
116, mice
116, in
116, the
116, air,
116, I'm
116, afraid,
116, but
116, you
116, might
116, catch
116, a
116, bat,
116, and
116, that's
116, very
117, like
117, a
117, mouse,
117, you
117, know.
117, But
117, do
117, cats
117, eat
117, bats,
117, I
117, wonder?'
117, And
117, here
117, Alice
118, began
118, to
118, get
118, rather
118, sleepy,
118, and
118, went
118, on
118, saying
118, to
118, herself,
118, in
118, a
118, dreamy
119, sort
119, of
119, way,
119, 'Do
119, cats
119, eat
119, bats?
119, Do
119, cats
119, eat
119, bats?'
119, and
119, sometimes,
119, 'Do
120, bats
120, eat
120, cats?'
120, for,
120, you
120, see,
120, as
120, she
120, couldn't
120, answer
120, either
120, question,
121, it
121, didn't
121, much
121, matter
121, which
121, way
121, she
121, put
121, it.
121, She
121, felt
121, that
121, she
121, was
121, dozing
122, off,
122, and
122, had
122, just
122, begun
122, to
122, dream
122, that
122, she
122, was
122, walking
122, hand
122, in
122, hand
122, with
123, Dinah,
123, and
123, saying
123, to
123, her
123, very
123, earnestly,
123, 'Now,
123, Dinah,
123, tell
123, me
123, the
123, truth:
124, did
124, you
124, ever
124, eat
124, a
124, bat?'
124, when
124, suddenly,
124, thump!
124, thump!
124, down
124, she
124, came
124, upon
125, a
125, heap
125, of
125, sticks
125, and
125, dry
125, leaves,
125, and
125, the
125, fall
125, was
125, over.
126, 
127, Alice
127, was
127, not
127, a
127, bit
127, hurt,
127, and
127, she
127, jumped
127, up
127, on
127, to
127, her
127, feet
127, in
127, a
127, moment:
128, she
128, looked
128, up,
128, but
128, it
128, was
128, all
128, dark
128, overhead;
128, before
128, her
128, was
128, another
129, long
129, passage,
129, and
129, the
129, White
129, Rabbit
129, was
129, still
129, in
129, sight,
129, hurrying
129, down
129, it.
130, There
130, was
130, not
130, a
130, moment
130, to
130, be
130, lost:
130, away
130, went
130, Alice
130, like
130, the
130, wind,
130, and
131, was
131, just
131, in
131, time
131, to
131, hear
131, it
131, say,
131, as
131, it
131, turned
131, a
131, corner,
131, 'Oh
131, my
131, ears
132, and
132, whiskers,
132, how
132, late
132, it's
132, getting!'
132, She
132, was
132, close
132, behind
132, it
132, when
132, she
133, turned
133, the
133, corner,
133, but
133, the
133, Rabbit
133, was
133, no
133, longer
133, to
133, be
133, seen:
133, she
133, found
134, herself
134, in
134, a
134, long,
134, low
134, hall,
134, which
134, was
134, lit
134, up
134, by
134, a
134, row
134, of
134, lamps
134, hanging
135, from
135, the
135, roof.
136, 
137, There
137, were
137, doors
137, all
137, round
137, the
137, hall,
137, but
137, they
137, were
137, all
137, locked;
137, and
137, when
138, Alice
138, had
138, been
138, all
138, the
138, way
138, down
138, one
138, side
138, and
138, up
138, the
138, other,
138, trying
138, every
139, door,
139, she
139, walked
139, sadly
139, down
139, the
139, middle,
139, wondering
139, how
139, she
139, was
139, ever
139, to
140, get
140, out
140, again.
141, 
142, Suddenly
142, she
142, came
142, upon
142, a
142, little
142, three-legged
142, table,
142, all
142, made
142, of
142, solid
143, glass;
143, there
143, was
143, nothing
143, on
143, it
143, except
143, a
143, tiny
143, golden
143, key,
143, and
143, Alice's
144, first
144, thought
144, was
144, that
144, it
144, might
144, belong
144, to
144, one
144, of
144, the
144, doors
144, of
144, the
144, hall;
145, but,
145, alas!
145, either
145, the
145, locks
145, were
145, too
145, large,
145, or
145, the
145, key
145, was
145, too
145, small,
146, but
146, at
146, any
146, rate
146, it
146, would
146, not
146, open
146, any
146, of
146, them.
146, However,
146, on
146, the
146, second
147, time
147, round,
147, she
147, came
147, upon
147, a
147, low
147, curtain
147, she
147, had
147, not
147, noticed
147, before,
147, and
148, behind
148, it
148, was
148, a
148, little
148, door
148, about
148, fifteen
148, inches
148, high:
148, she
148, tried
148, the
149, little
149, golden
149, key
149, in
149, the
149, lock,
149, and
149, to
149, her
149, great
149, delight
149, it
149, fitted!
150, 
151, Alice
151, opened
151, the
151, door
151, and
151, found
151, that
151, it
151, led
151, into
151, a
151, small
151, passage,
151, not
152, much
152, larger
152, than
152, a
152, rat-hole:
152, she
152, knelt
152, down
152, and
152, looked
152, along
152, the
152, passage
153, into
153, the
153, loveliest
153, garden
153, you
153, ever
153, saw.
153, How
153, she
153, longed
153, to
153, get
153, out
153, of
154, that
154, dark
154, hall,
154, and
154, wander
154, about
154, among
154, those
154, beds
154, of
154, bright
154, flowers
154, and
155, those
155, cool
155, fountains,
155, but
155, she
155, could
155, not
155, even
155, get
155, her
155, head
155, through
155, the
156, doorway;
156, 'and
156, even
156, if
156, my
156, head
156, would
156, go
156, through,'
156, thought
156, poor
156, Alice,
156, 'it
157, would
157, be
157, of
157, very
157, little
157, use
157, without
157, my
157, shoulders.
157, Oh,
157, how
157, I
157, wish
157, I
157, could
158, shut
158, up
158, like
158, a
158, telescope!
158, I
158, think
158, I
158, could,
158, if
158, I
158, only
158, know
158, how
158, to
158, begin.'
159, For,
159, you
159, see,
159, so
159, many
159, out-of-the-way
159, things
159, had
159, happened
159, lately,
160, that
160, Alice
160, had
160, begun
160, to
160, think
160, that
160, very
160, few
160, things
160, indeed
160, were
160, really
161, impossible.
162, 
163, There
163, seemed
163, to
163, be
163, no
163, use
163, in
163, waiting
163, by
163, the
163, little
163, door,
163, so
163, she
163, went
164, back
164, to
164, the
164, table,
164, half
164, hoping
164, she
164, might
164, find
164, another
164, key
164, on
164, it,
164, or
164, at
165, any
165, rate
165, a
165, book
165, of
165, rules
165, for
165, shutting
165, people
165, up
165, like
165, telescopes:
165, this
166, time
166, she
166, found
166, a
166, little
166, bottle
166, on
166, it,
166, ('which
166, certainly
166, was
166, not
166, here
167, before,'
167, said
167, Alice,)
167, and
167, round
167, the
167, neck
167, of
167, the
167, bottle
167, was
167, a
167, paper
168, label,
168, with
168, the
168, words
168, 'DRINK
168, ME'
168, beautifully
168, printed
168, on
168, it
168, in
168, large
169, letters.
170, 
171, It
171, was
171, all
171, very
171, well
171, to
171, say
171, 'Drink
171, me,'
171, but
171, the
171, wise
171, little
171, Alice
171, was
172, not
172, going
172, to
172, do
172, THAT
172, in
172, a
172, hurry.
172, 'No,
172, I'll
172, look
172, first,'
172, she
172, said,
172, 'and
173, see
173, whether
173, it's
173, marked
173, "poison"
173, or
173, not';
173, for
173, she
173, had
173, read
173, several
173, nice
174, little
174, histories
174, about
174, children
174, who
174, had
174, got
174, burnt,
174, and
174, eaten
174, up
174, by
174, wild
175, beasts
175, and
175, other
175, unpleasant
175, things,
175, all
175, because
175, they
175, WOULD
175, not
175, remember
176, the
176, simple
176, rules
176, their
176, friends
176, had
176, taught
176, them:
176, such
176, as,
176, that
176, a
176, red-hot
177, poker
177, will
177, burn
177, you
177, if
177, you
177, hold
177, it
177, too
177, long;
177, and
177, that
177, if
177, you
177, cut
177, your
178, finger
178, VERY
178, deeply
178, with
178, a
178, knife,
178, it
178, usually
178, bleeds;
178, and
178, she
178, had
178, never
179, forgotten
179, that,
179, if
179, you
179, drink
179, much
179, from
179, a
179, bottle
179, marked
179, 'poison,'
179, it
179, is
180, almost
180, certain
180, to
180, disagree
180, with
180, you,
180, sooner
180, or
180, later.
181, 
182, However,
182, this
182, bottle
182, was
182, NOT
182, marked
182, 'poison,'
182, so
182, Alice
182, ventured
182, to
182, taste
183, it,
183, and
183, finding
183, it
183, very
183, nice,
183, (it
183, had,
183, in
183, fact,
183, a
183, sort
183, of
183, mixed
183, flavour
184, of
184, cherry-tart,
184, custard,
184, pine-apple,
184, roast
184, turkey,
184, toffee,
184, and
184, hot
185, buttered
185, toast,)
185, she
185, very
185, soon
185, finished
185, it
185, off.

193, 'What
193, a
193, curious
193, feeling!'
193, said
193, Alice;
193, 'I
193, must
193, be
193, shutting
193, up
193, like
193, a
194, telescope.'
195, 
196, And
196, so
196, it
196, was
196, indeed:
196, she
196, was
196, now
196, only
196, ten
196, inches
196, high,
196, and
196, her
196, face
197, brightened
197, up
197, at
197, the
197, thought
197, that
197, she
197, was
197, now
197, the
197, right
197, size
197, for
197, going
198, through
198, the
198, little
198, door
198, into
198, that
198, lovely
198, garden.
198, First,
198, however,
198, she
199, waited
199, for
199, a
199, few
199, minutes
199, to
199, see
199, if
199, she
199, was
199, going
199, to
199, shrink
199, any
199, further:
200, she
200, felt
200, a
200, little
200, nervous
200, about
200, this;
200, 'for
200, it
200, might
200, end,
200, you
200, know,'
200, said
201, Alice
201, to
201, herself,
201, 'in
201, my
201, going
201, out
201, altogether,
201, like
201, a
201, candle.
201, I
201, wonder
202, what
202, I
202, should
202, be
202, like
202, then?'
202, And
202, she
202, tried
202, to
202, fancy
202, what
202, the
202, flame
202, of
202, a
203, candle
203, is
203, like
203, after
203, the
203, candle
203, is
203, blown
203, out,
203, for
203, she
203, could
203, not
203, remember
204, ever
204, having
204, seen
204, such
204, a
204, thing.
205, 
206, After
206, a
206, while,
206, finding
206, that
206, nothing
206, more
206, happened,
206, she
206, decided
206, on
206, going
207, into
207, the
207, garden
207, at
207, once;
207, but,
207, alas
207, for
207, poor
207, Alice!
207, when
207, she
207, got
207, to
207, the
208, door,
208, she
208, found
208, she
208, had
208, forgotten
208, the
208, little
208, golden
208, key,
208, and
208, when
208, she
209, went
209, back
209, to
209, the
209, table
209, for
209, it,
209, she
209, found
209, she
209, could
209, not
209, possibly
209, reach
210, it:
210, she
210, could
210, see
210, it
210, quite
210, plainly
210, through
210, the
210, glass,
210, and
210, she
210, tried
210, her
211, best
211, to
211, climb
211, up
211, one
211, of
211, the
211, legs
211, of
211, the
211, table,
211, but
211, it
211, was
211, too
211, slippery;
212, and
212, when
212, she
212, had
212, tired
212, herself
212, out
212, with
212, trying,
212, the
212, poor
212, little
212, thing
213, sat
213, down
213, and
213, cried.
214, 
215, 'Come,
215, there's
215, no
215, use
215, in
215, crying
215, like
215, that!'
215, said
215, Alice
215, to
215, herself,
216, rather
216, sharply;
216, 'I
216, advise
216, you
216, to
216, leave
216, off
216, this
216, minute!'
216, She
216, generally
217, gave
217, herself
217, very
217, good
217, advice,
217, (though
217, she
217, very
217, seldom
217, followed
217, it),
218, and
218, sometimes
218, she
218, scolded
218, herself
218, so
218, severely
218, as
218, to
218, bring
218, tears
218, into
219, her
219, eyes;
219, and
219, once
219, she
219, remembered
219, trying
219, to
219, box
219, her
219, own
219, ears
219, for
219, having
220, cheated
220, herself
220, in
220, a
220, game
220, of
220, croquet
220, she
220, was
220, playing
220, against
220, herself,
221, for
221, this
221, curious
221, child
221, was
221, very
221, fond
221, of
221, pretending
221, to
221, be
221, two
221, people.
222, 'But
222, it's
222, no
222, use
222, now,'
222, thought
222, poor
222, Alice,
222, 'to
222, pretend
222, to
222, be
222, two
222, people!
223, Why,
223, there's
223, hardly
223, enough
223, of
223, me
223, left
223, to
223, make
223, ONE
223, respectable
223, person!'
224, 
225, Soon
225, her
225, eye
225, fell
225, on
225, a
225, little
225, glass
225, box
225, that
225, was
225, lying
225, under
225, the
225, table:
226, she
226, opened
226, it,
226, and
226, found
226, in
226, it
226, a
226, very
226, small
226, cake,
226, on
226, which
226, the
226, words
227, 'EAT
227, ME'
227, were
227, beautifully
227, marked
227, in
227, currants.
227, 'Well,
227, I'll
227, eat
227, it,'
227, said
228, Alice,
228, 'and
228, if
228, it
228, makes
228, me
228, grow
228, larger,
228, I
228, can
228, reach
228, the
228, key;
228, and
228, if
228, it
229, makes
229, me
229, grow
229, smaller,
229, I
229, can
229, creep
229, under
229, the
229, door;
229, so
229, either
229, way
229, I'll
230, get
230, into
230, the
230, garden,
230, and
230, I
230, don't
230, care
230, which
230, happens!'
231, 
232, She
232, ate
232, a
232, little
232, bit,
232, and
232, said
232, anxiously
232, to
232, herself,
232, 'Which
232, way?
232, Which
233, way?',
233, holding
233, her
233, hand
233, on
233, the
233, top
233, of
233, her
233, head
233, to
233, feel
233, which
233, way
233, it
233, was
234, growing,
234, and
234, she
234, was
234, quite
234, surprised
234, to
234, find
234, that
234, she
234, remained
234, the
234, same
235, size:
235, to
235, be
235, sure,
235, this
235, generally
235, happens
235, when
235, one
235, eats
235, cake,
235, but
235, Alice
236, had
236, got
236, so
236, much
236, into
236, the
236, way
236, of
236, expecting
236, nothing
236, but
236, out-of-the-way
237, things
237, to
237, happen,
237, that
237, it
237, seemed
237, quite
237, dull
237, and
237, stupid
237, for
237, life
237, to
237, go
237, on
238, in
238, the
238, common
238, way.
239, 
240, So
240, she
240, set
240, to
240, work,
240, and
240, very
240, soon
240, finished
240, off
240, the
240, cake.

251, CHAPTER
251, II.
251, The
251, Pool
251, of
251, Tears
252, 
253, 'Curiouser
253, and
253, curiouser!'
253, cried
253, Alice
253, (she
253, was
253, so
253, much
253, surprised,
253, that
254, for
254, the
254, moment
254, she
254, quite
254, forgot
254, how
254, to
254, speak
254, good
254, English);
254, 'now
254, I'm
255, opening
255, out
255, like
255, the
255, largest
255, telescope
255, that
255, ever
255, was!
255, Good-bye,
255, feet!'
256, (for
256, when
256, she
256, looked
256, down
256, at
256, her
256, feet,
256, they
256, seemed
256, to
256, be
256, almost
256, out
256, of
257, sight,
257, they
257, were
257, getting
257, so
257, far
257, off).
257, 'Oh,
257, my
257, poor
257, little
257, feet,
257, I
257, wonder
258, who
258, will
258, put
258, on
258, your
258, shoes
258, and
258, stockings
258, for
258, you
258, now,
258, dears?
258, I'm
258, sure
259, _I_
259, shan't
259, be
259, able!
259, I
259, shall
259, be
259, a
259, great
259, deal
259, too
259, far
259, off
259, to
259, trouble
260, myself
260, about
260, you:
260, you
260, must
260, manage
260, the
260, best
260, way
260, you
260, can;--but
260, I
260, must
260, be
261, kind
261, to
261, them,'
261, thought
261, Alice,
261, 'or
261, perhaps
261, they
261, won't
261, walk
261, the
261, way
261, I
261, want
262, to
262, go!
262, Let
262, me
262, see:
262, I'll
262, give
262, them
262, a
262, new
262, pair
262, of
262, boots
262, every
262, Christmas.'
263, 
264, And
264, she
264, went
264, on
264, planning
264, to
264, herself
264, how
264, she
264, would
264, manage
264, it.
264, 'They
264, must
265, go
265, by
265, the
265, carrier,'
265, she
265, thought;
265, 'and
265, how
265, funny
265, it'll
265, seem,
265, sending
266, presents
266, to
266, one's
266, own
266, feet!
266, And
266, how
266, odd
266, the
266, directions
266, will
266, look!
267, 
268, ALICE'S
268, RIGHT
268, FOOT,
268, ESQ.
269, HEARTHRUG,
270, NEAR
270, THE
270, FENDER,
271, (WITH
271, ALICE'S
271, LOVE).
272, 
273, Oh
273, dear,
273, what
273, nonsense
273, I'm
273, talking!'
274, 
275, Just
275, then
275, her
275, head
275, struck
275, against
275, the
275, roof
275, of
275, the
275, hall:
275, in
275, fact
275, she
275, was
276, now
276, more
276, than
276, nine
276, feet
276, high,
276, and
276, she
276, at
276, once
276, took
276, up
276, the
276, little
276, golden
277, key
277, and
277, hurried
277, off
277, to
277, the
277, garden
277, door.
278, 
279, Poor
279, Alice!
279, It
279, was
279, as
279, much
279, as
279, she
279, could
279, do,
279, lying
279, down
279, on
279, one
279, side,
279, to
280, look
280, through
280, into
280, the
280, garden
280, with
280, one
280, eye;
280, but
280, to
280, get
280, through
280, was
280, more
281, hopeless
281, than
281, ever:
281, she
281, sat
281, down
281, and
281, began
281, to
281, cry
281, again.
282, 
283, 'You
283, ought
283, to
283, be
283, ashamed
283, of
283, yourself,'
283, said
283, Alice,
283, 'a
283, great
283, girl
283, like
284, you,'
284, (she
284, might
284, well
284, say
284, this),
284, 'to
284, go
284, on
284, crying
284, in
284, this
284, way!
284, Stop
284, this
285, moment,
285, I
285, tell
285, you!'
285, But
285, she
285, went
285, on
285, all
285, the
285, same,
285, shedding
285, gallons
285, of
286, tears,
286, until
286, there
286, was
286, a
286, large
286, pool
286, all
286, round
286, her,
286, about
286, four
286, inches
287, deep
287, and
287, reaching
287, half
287, down
287, the
287, hall.
288, 
289, After
289, a
289, time
289, she
289, heard
289, a
289, little
289, pattering
289, of
289, feet
289, in
289, the
289, distance,
289, and
290, she
290, hastily
290, dried
290, her
290, eyes
290, to
290, see
290, what
290, was
290, coming.
290, It
290, was
290, the
290, White
291, Rabbit
291, returning,
291, splendidly
291, dressed,
291, with
291, a
291, pair
291, of
291, white
291, kid
291, gloves
291, in
292, one
292, hand
292, and
292, a
292, large
292, fan
292, in
292, the
292, other:
292, he
292, came
292, trotting
292, along
292, in
292, a
292, great
293, hurry,
293, muttering
293, to
293, himself
293, as
293, he
293, came,
293, 'Oh!
293, the
293, Duchess,
293, the
293, Duchess!
294, Oh!
294, won't
294, she
294, be
294, savage
294, if
294, I've
294, kept
294, her
294, waiting!'
294, Alice
294, felt
294, so
295, desperate
295, that
295, she
295, was
295, ready
295, to
295, ask
295, help
295, of
295, any
295, one;
295, so,
295, when
295, the
295, Rabbit
296, came
296, near
296, her,
296, she
296, began,
296, in
296, a
296, low,
296, timid
296, voice,
296, 'If
296, you
296, please,
296, sir--'
297, The
297, Rabbit
297, started
297, violently,
297, dropped
297, the
297, white
297, kid
297, gloves
297, and
297, the
297, fan,
298, and
298, skurried
298, away
298, into
298, the
298, darkness
298, as
298, hard
298, as
298, he
298, could
298, go.
299, 
300, Alice
300, took
300, up
300, the
300, fan
300, and
300, gloves,
300, and,
300, as
300, the
300, hall
300, was
300, very
300, hot,
300, she
301, kept
301, fanning
301, herself
301, all
301, the
301, time
301, she
301, went
301, on
301, talking:
301, 'Dear,
301, dear!
301, How
302, queer
302, everything
302, is
302, to-day!
302, And
302, yesterday
302, things
302, went
302, on
302, just
302, as
302, usual.
303, I
303, wonder
303, if
303, I've
303, been
303, changed
303, in
303, the
303, night?
303, Let
303, me
303, think:
303, was
303, I
303, the
304, same
304, when
304, I
304, got
304, up
304, this
304, morning?
304, I
304, almost
304, think
304, I
304, can
304, remember
304, feeling
304, a
305, little
305, different.
305, But
305, if
305, I'm
305, not
305, the
305, same,
305, the
305, next
305, question
305, is,
305, Who
306, in
306, the
306, world
306, am
306, I?
306, Ah,
306, THAT'S
306, the
306, great
306, puzzle!'
306, And
306, she
306, began
306, thinking
307, over
307, all
307, the
307, children
307, she
307, knew
307, that
307, were
307, of
307, the
307, same
307, age
307, as
307, herself,
307, to
308, see
308, if
308, she
308, could
308, have
308, been
308, changed
308, for
308, any
308, of
308, them.
309, 
310, 'I'm
310, sure
310, I'm
310, not
310, Ada,'
310, she
310, said,
310, 'for
310, her
310, hair
310, goes
310, in
310, such
310, long
311, ringlets,
311, and
311, mine
311, doesn't
311, go
311, in
311, ringlets
311, at
311, all;
311, and
311, I'm
311, sure
311, I
311, can't
312, be
312, Mabel,
312, for
312, I
312, know
312, all
312, sorts
312, of
312, things,
312, and
312, she,
312, oh!
312, she
312, knows
312, such
312, a
313, very
313, little!
313, Besides,
313, SHE'S
313, she,
313, and
313, I'm
313, I,
313, and--oh
313, dear,
313, how
313, puzzling
314, it
314, all
314, is!
314, I'll
314, try
314, if
314, I
314, know
314, all
314, the
314, things
314, I
314, used
314, to
314, know.
314, Let
314, me
315, see:
315, four
315, times
315, five
315, is
315, twelve,
315, and
315, four
315, times
315, six
315, is
315, thirteen,
315, and
316, four
316, times
316, seven
316, is--oh
316, dear!
316, I
316, shall
316, never
316, get
316, to
316, twenty
316, at
316, that
316, rate!
317, However,
317, the
317, Multiplication
317, Table
317, doesn't
317, signify:
317, let's
317, try
317, Geography.
318, London
318, is
318, the
318, capital
318, of
318, Paris,
318, and
318, Paris
318, is
318, the
318, capital
318, of
318, Rome,
318, and
319, Rome--no,
319, THAT'S
319, all
319, wrong,
319, I'm
319, certain!
319, I
319, must
319, have
319, been
319, changed
319, for
320, Mabel!
320, I'll
320, try
320, and
320, say
320, "How
320, doth
320, the
320, little--"'
320, and
320, she
320, crossed
320, her
321, hands
321, on
321, her
321, lap
321, as
321, if
321, she
321, were
321, saying
321, lessons,
321, and
321, began
321, to
321, repeat
321, it,
322, but
322, her
322, voice
322, sounded
322, hoarse
322, and
322, strange,
322, and
322, the
322, words
322, did
322, not
322, come
322, the
323, same
323, as
323, they
323, used
323, to
323, do:--
324, 
325, 'How
325, doth
325, the
325, little
325, crocodile
326, Improve
326, his
326, shining
326, tail,
327, And
327, pour
327, the
327, waters
327, of
327, the
327, Nile
328, On
328, every
328, golden
328, scale!
329, 
330, 'How
330, cheerfully
330, he
330, seems
330, to
330, grin,
331, How
331, neatly
331, spread
331, his
331, claws,
332, And
332, welcome
332, little
332, fishes
332, in
333, With
333, gently
333, smiling
333, jaws!'
334, 
335, 'I'm
335, sure
335, those
335, are
335, not
335, the
335, right
335, words,'
335, said
335, poor
335, Alice,
335, and
335, her
335, eyes
336, filled
336, with
336, tears
336, again
336, as
336, she
336, went
336, on,
336, 'I
336, must
336, be
336, Mabel
336, after
336, all,
336, and
337, I
337, shall
337, have
337, to
337, go
337, and
337, live
337, in
337, that
337, poky
337, little
337, house,
337, and
337, have
337, next
337, to
338, no
338, toys
338, to
338, play
338, with,
338, and
338, oh!
338, ever
338, so
338, many
338, lessons
338, to
338, learn!
338, No,
338, I've
339, made
339, up
339, my
339, mind
339, about
339, it;
339, if
339, I'm
339, Mabel,
339, I'll
339, stay
339, down
339, here!
339, It'll
339, be
339, no
340, use
340, their
340, putting
340, their
340, heads
340, down
340, and
340, saying
340, "Come
340, up
340, again,
340, dear!"
340, I
341, shall
341, only
341, look
341, up
341, and
341, say
341, "Who
341, am
341, I
341, then?
341, Tell
341, me
341, that
341, first,
341, and
341, then,
342, if
342, I
342, like
342, being
342, that
342, person,
342, I'll
342, come
342, up:
342, if
342, not,
342, I'll
342, stay
342, down
342, here
343, till
343, I'm
343, somebody
343, else"--but,
343, oh
343, dear!'
343, cried
343, Alice,
343, with
343, a
343, sudden
343, burst
344, of
344, tears,
344, 'I
344, do
344, wish
344, they
344, WOULD
344, put
344, their
344, heads
344, down!
344, I
344, am
344, so
344, VERY
344, tired
345, of
345, being
345, all
345, alone
345, here!'
346, 
347, As
347, she
347, said
347, this
347, she
347, looked
347, down
347, at
347, her
347, hands,
347, and
347, was
347, surprised
347, to
347, see
348, that
348, she
348, had
348, put
348, on
348, one
348, of
348, the
348, Rabbit's
348, little
348, white
348, kid
348, gloves
348, while
349, she
349, was
349, talking.
349, 'How
349, CAN
349, I
349, have
349, done
349, that?'
349, she
349, thought.
349, 'I
349, must
350, be
350, growing
350, small
350, again.'
350, She
350, got
350, up
350, and
350, went
350, to
350, the
350, table
350, to
350, measure
351, herself
351, by
351, it,
351, and
351, found
351, that,
351, as
351, nearly
351, as
351, she
351, could
351, guess,
351, she
351, was
351, now
352, about
352, two
352, feet
352, high,
352, and
352, was
352, going
352, on
352, shrinking
352, rapidly:
352, she
352, soon
352, found
353, out
353, that
353, the
353, cause
353, of
353, this
353, was
353, the
353, fan
353, she
353, was
353, holding,
353, and
353, she
353, dropped
354, it
354, hastily,
354, just
354, in
354, time
354, to
354, avoid
354, shrinking
354, away
354, altogether.
355, 
356, 'That
356, WAS
356, a
356, narrow
356, escape!'
356, said
356, Alice,
356, a
356, good
356, deal
356, frightened
356, at
356, the
357, sudden
357, change,
357, but
357, very
357, glad
357, to
357, find
357, herself
357, still
357, in
357, existence;
357, 'and
358, now
358, for
358, the
358, garden!'
358, and
358, she
358, ran
358, with
358, all
358, speed
358, back
358, to
358, the
358, little
358, door:
359, but,
359, alas!
359, the
359, little
359, door
359, was
359, shut
359, again,
359, and
359, the
359, little
359, golden
359, key
359, was
360, lying
360, on
360, the
360, glass
360, table
360, as
360, before,
360, 'and
360, things
360, are
360, worse
360, than
360, ever,'
361, thought
361, the
361, poor
361, child,
361, 'for
361, I
361, never
361, was
361, so
361, small
361, as
361, this
361, before,
361, never!
362, And
362, I
362, declare
362, it's
362, too
362, bad,
362, that
362, it
362, is!'
363, 
364, As
364, she
364, said
364, these
364, words
364, her
364, foot
364, slipped,
364, and
364, in
364, another
364, moment,
364, splash!
365, she
365, was
365, up
365, to
365, her
365, chin
365, in
365, salt
365, water.
365, Her
365, first
365, idea
365, was
365, that
365, she
366, had
366, somehow
366, fallen
366, into
366, the
366, sea,
366, 'and
366, in
366, that
366, case
366, I
366, can
366, go
366, back
366, by
367, railway,'
367, she
367, said
367, to
367, herself.
367, (Alice
367, had
367, been
367, to
367, the
367, seaside
367, once
367, in
368, her
368, life,
368, and
368, had
368, come
368, to
368, the
368, general
368, conclusion,
368, that
368, wherever
368, you
368, go
369, to
369, on
369, the
369, English
369, coast
369, you
369, find
369, a
369, number
369, of
369, bathing
369, machines
369, in
369, the
370, sea,
370, some
370, children
370, digging
370, in
370, the
370, sand
370, with
370, wooden
370, spades,
370, then
370, a
370, row
371, of
371, lodging
371, houses,
371, and
371, behind
371, them
371, a
371, railway
371, station.)
371, However,
371, she
371, soon
372, made
372, out
372, that
372, she
372, was
372, in
372, the
372, pool
372, of
372, tears
372, which
372, she
372, had
372, wept
372, when
372, she
373, was
373, nine
373, feet
373, high.
374, 
375, 'I
375, wish
375, I
375, hadn't
375, cried
375, so
375, much!'
375, said
375, Alice,
375, as
375, she
375, swam
375, about,
375, trying
376, to
376, find
376, her
376, way
376, out.
376, 'I
376, shall
376, be
376, punished
376, for
376, it
376, now,
376, I
376, suppose,
376, by
377, being
377, drowned
377, in
377, my
377, own
377, tears!
377, That
377, WILL
377, be
377, a
377, queer
377, thing,
377, to
377, be
377, sure!
378, However,
378, everything
378, is
378, queer
378, to-day.'
379, 
380, Just
380, then
380, she
380, heard
380, something
380, splashing
380, about
380, in
380, the
380, pool
380, a
380, little
380, way
381, off,
381, and
381, she
381, swam
381, nearer
381, to
381, make
381, out
381, what
381, it
381, was:
381, at
381, first
381, she
381, thought
382, it
382, must
382, be
382, a
382, walrus
382, or
382, hippopotamus,
382, but
382, then
382, she
382, remembered
382, how
382, small
383, she
383, was
383, now,
383, and
383, she
383, soon
383, made
383, out
383, that
383, it
383, was
383, only
383, a
383, mouse
383, that
383, had
384, slipped
384, in
384, like
384, herself.
385, 
386, 'Would
386, it
386, be
386, of
386, any
386, use,
386, now,'
386, thought
386, Alice,
386, 'to
386, speak
386, to
386, this
386, mouse?
387, Everything
387, is
387, so
387, out-of-the-way
387, down
387, here,
387, that
387, I
387, should
387, think
387, very
388, likely
388, it
388, can
388, talk:
388, at
388, any
388, rate,
388, there's
388, no
388, harm
388, in
388, trying.'
388, So
388, she
389, began:
389, 'O
389, Mouse,
389, do
389, you
389, know
389, the
389, way
389, out
389, of
389, this
389, pool?
389, I
389, am
389, very
389, tired
390, of
390, swimming
390, about
390, here,
390, O
390, Mouse!'
390, (Alice
390, thought
390, this
390, must
390, be
390, the
390, right
391, way
391, of
391, speaking
391, to
391, a
391, mouse:
391, she
391, had
391, never
391, done
391, such
391, a
391, thing
391, before,
391, but
392, she
392, remembered
392, having
392, seen
392, in
392, her
392, brother's
392, Latin
392, Grammar,
392, 'A
392, mouse--of
393, a
393, mouse--to
393, a
393, mouse--a
393, mouse--O
393, mouse!')
393, The
393, Mouse
393, looked
393, at
393, her
393, rather
394, inquisitively,
394, and
394, seemed
394, to
394, her
394, to
394, wink
394, with
394, one
394, of
394, its
394, little
394, eyes,
395, but
395, it
395, said
395, nothing.
396, 
397, 'Perhaps
397, it
397, doesn't
397, understand
397, English,'
397, thought
397, Alice;
397, 'I
397, daresay
397, it's
398, a
398, French
398, mouse,
398, come
398, over
398, with
398, William
398, the
398, Conqueror.'
398, (For,
398, with
398, all
399, her
399, knowledge
399, of
399, history,
399, Alice
399, had
399, no
399, very
399, clear
399, notion
399, how
399, long
399, ago
400, anything
400, had
400, happened.)
400, So
400, she
400, began
400, again:
400, 'Ou
400, est
400, ma
400, chatte?'
400, which
401, was
401, the
401, first
401, sentence
401, in
401, her
401, French
401, lesson-book.
401, The
401, Mouse
401, gave
401, a
402, sudden
402, leap
402, out
402, of
402, the
402, water,
402, and
402, seemed
402, to
402, quiver
402, all
402, over
402, with
402, fright.
403, 'Oh,
403, I
403, beg
403, your
403, pardon!'
403, cried
403, Alice
403, hastily,
403, afraid
403, that
403, she
403, had
403, hurt
404, the
404, poor
404, animal's
404, feelings.
404, 'I
404, quite
404, forgot
404, you
404, didn't
404, like
404, cats.'
405, 
406, 'Not
406, like
406, cats!'
406, cried
406, the
406, Mouse,
406, in
406, a
406, shrill,
406, passionate
406, voice.
406, 'Would
407, YOU
407, like
407, cats
407, if
407, you
407, were
407, me?'
408, 
409, 'Well,
409, perhaps
409, not,'
409, said
409, Alice
409, in
409, a
409, soothing
409, tone:
409, 'don't
409, be
409, angry
410, about
410, it.
410, And
410, yet
410, I
410, wish
410, I
410, could
410, show
410, you
410, our
410, cat
410, Dinah:
410, I
410, think
410, you'd
411, take
411, a
411, fancy
411, to
411, cats
411, if
411, you
411, could
411, only
411, see
411, her.
411, She
411, is
411, such
411, a
411, dear
411, quiet
412, thing,'
412, Alice
412, went
412, on,
412, half
412, to
412, herself,
412, as
412, she
412, swam
412, lazily
412, about
412, in
412, the
413, pool,
413, 'and
413, she
413, sits
413, purring
413, so
413, nicely
413, by
413, the
413, fire,
413, licking
413, her
413, paws
413, and
414, washing
414, her
414, face--and
414, she
414, is
414, such
414, a
414, nice
414, soft
414, thing
414, to
414, nurse--and
414, she's
415, such
415, a
415, capital
415, one
415, for
415, catching
415, mice--oh,
415, I
415, beg
415, your
415, pardon!'
415, cried
416, Alice
416, again,
416, for
416, this
416, time
416, the
416, Mouse
416, was
416, bristling
416, all
416, over,
416, and
416, she
417, felt
417, certain
417, it
417, must
417, be
417, really
417, offended.
417, 'We
417, won't
417, talk
417, about
417, her
417, any
418, more
418, if
418, you'd
418, rather
418, not.'
419, 
420, 'We
420, indeed!'
420, cried
420, the
420, Mouse,
420, who
420, was
420, trembling
420, down
420, to
420, the
420, end
420, of
420, his
421, tail.
421, 'As
421, if
421, I
421, would
421, talk
421, on
421, such
421, a
421, subject!
421, Our
421, family
421, always
421, HATED
422, cats:
422, nasty,
422, low,
422, vulgar
422, things!
422, Don't
422, let
422, me
422, hear
422, the
422, name
422, again!'
423, 
424, 'I
424, won't
424, indeed!'
424, said
424, Alice,
424, in
424, a
424, great
424, hurry
424, to
424, change
424, the
424, subject
424, of
425, conversation.
425, 'Are
425, you--are
425, you
425, fond--of--of
425, dogs?'
425, The
425, Mouse
425, did
425, not
426, answer,
426, so
426, Alice
426, went
426, on
426, eagerly:
426, 'There
426, is
426, such
426, a
426, nice
426, little
426, dog
426, near
427, our
427, house
427, I
427, should
427, like
427, to
427, show
427, you!
427, A
427, little
427, bright-eyed
427, terrier,
427, you
428, know,
428, with
428, oh,
428, such
428, long
428, curly
428, brown
428, hair!
428, And
428, it'll
428, fetch
428, things
428, when
429, you
429, throw
429, them,
429, and
429, it'll
429, sit
429, up
429, and
429, beg
429, for
429, its
429, dinner,
429, and
429, all
429, sorts
430, of
430, things--I
430, can't
430, remember
430, half
430, of
430, them--and
430, it
430, belongs
430, to
430, a
430, farmer,
431, you
431, know,
431, and
431, he
431, says
431, it's
431, so
431, useful,
431, it's
431, worth
431, a
431, hundred
431, pounds!
431, He
432, says
432, it
432, kills
432, all
432, the
432, rats
432, and--oh
432, dear!'
432, cried
432, Alice
432, in
432, a
432, sorrowful
433, tone,
433, 'I'm
433, afraid
433, I've
433, offended
433, it
433, again!'
433, For
433, the
433, Mouse
433, was
433, swimming
434, away
434, from
434, her
434, as
434, hard
434, as
434, it
434, could
434, go,
434, and
434, making
434, quite
434, a
434, commotion
434, in
435, the
435, pool
435, as
435, it
435, went.
436, 
437, So
437, she
437, called
437, softly
437, after
437, it,
437, 'Mouse
437, dear!
437, Do
437, come
437, back
437, again,
437, and
437, we
438, won't
438, talk
438, about
438, cats
438, or
438, dogs
438, either,
438, if
438, you
438, don't
438, like
438, them!'
438, When
438, the
439, Mouse
439, heard
439, this,
439, it
439, turned
439, round
439, and
439, swam
439, slowly
439, back
439, to
439, her:
439, its
440, face
440, was
440, quite
440, pale
440, (with
440, passion,
440, Alice
440, thought),
440, and
440, it
440, said
440, in
440, a
440, low
441, trembling
441, voice,
441, 'Let
441, us
441, get
441, to
441, the
441, shore,
441, and
441, then
441, I'll
441, tell
441, you
441, my
442, history,
442, and
442, you'll
442, understand
442, why
442, it
442, is
442, I
442, hate
442, cats
442, and
442, dogs.'
443, 
444, It
444, was
444, high
444, time
444, to
444, go,
444, for
444, the
444, pool
444, was
444, getting
444, quite
444, crowded
444, with
444, the
445, birds
445, and
445, animals
445, that
445, had
445, fallen
445, into
445, it:
445, there
445, were
445, a
445, Duck
445, and
445, a
445, Dodo,
446, a
446, Lory
446, and
446, an
446, Eaglet,
446, and
446, several
446, other
446, curious
446, creatures.
446, Alice
446, led
446, the
447, way,
447, and
447, the
447, whole
447, party
447, swam
447, to
447, the
447, shore.

450, 
451, 
452, CHAPTER
452, III.
452, A
452, Caucus-Race
452, and
452, a
452, Long
452, Tale
453, 
454, They
454, were
454, indeed
454, a
454, queer-looking
454, party
454, that
454, assembled
454, on
454, the
454, bank--the
455, birds
455, with
455, draggled
455, feathers,
455, the
455, animals
455, with
455, their
455, fur
455, clinging
455, close
456, to
456, them,
456, and
456, all
456, dripping
456, wet,
456, cross,
456, and
456, uncomfortable.
457, 
458, The
458, first
458, question
458, of
458, course
458, was,
458, how
458, to
458, get
458, dry
458, again:
458, they
458, had
458, a
459, consultation
459, about
459, this,
459, and
459, after
459, a
459, few
459, minutes
459, it
459, seemed
459, quite
459, natural
460, to
460, Alice
460, to
460, find
460, herself
460, talking
460, familiarly
460, with
460, them,
460, as
460, if
460, she
460, had
461, known
461, them
461, all
461, her
461, life.
461, Indeed,
461, she
461, had
461, quite
461, a
461, long
461, argument
461, with
461, the
462, Lory,
462, who
462, at
462, last
462, turned
462, sulky,
462, and
462, would
462, only
462, say,
462, 'I
462, am
462, older
462, than
463, you,
463, and
463, must
463, know
463, better';
463, and
463, this
463, Alice
463, would
463, not
463, allow
463, without
464, knowing
464, how
464, old
464, it
464, was,
464, and,
464, as
464, the
464, Lory
464, positively
464, refused
464, to
464, tell
464, its
465, age,
465, there
465, was
465, no
465, more
465, to
465, be
465, said.
466, 
467, At
467, last
467, the
467, Mouse,
467, who
467, seemed
467, to
467, be
467, a
467, person
467, of
467, authority
467, among
467, them,
468, called
468, out,
468, 'Sit
468, down,
468, all
468, of
468, you,
468, and
468, listen
468, to
468, me!
468, I'LL
468, soon
468, make
468, you
469, dry
469, enough!'
469, They
469, all
469, sat
469, down
469, at
469, once,
469, in
469, a
469, large
469, ring,
469, with
469, the
469, Mouse
470, in
470, the
470, middle.
470, Alice
470, kept
470, her
470, eyes
470, anxiously
470, fixed
470, on
470, it,
470, for
470, she
470, felt
471, sure
471, she
471, would
471, catch
471, a
471, bad
471, cold
471, if
471, she
471, did
471, not
471, get
471, dry
471, very
471, soon.
472, 
473, 'Ahem!'
473, said
473, the
473, Mouse
473, with
473, an
473, important
473, air,
473, 'are
473, you
473, all
473, ready?
473, This
474, is
474, the
474, driest
474, thing
474, I
474, know.
474, Silence
474, all
474, round,
474, if
474, you
474, please!
474, "William
475, the
475, Conqueror,
475, whose
475, cause
475, was
475, favoured
475, by
475, the
475, pope,
475, was
475, soon
475, submitted
476, to
476, by
476, the
476, English,
476, who
476, wanted
476, leaders,
476, and
476, had
476, been
476, of
476, late
476, much
477, accustomed
477, to
477, usurpation
477, and
477, conquest.
477, Edwin
477, and
477, Morcar,
477, the
477, earls
477, of
478, Mercia
478, and
478, Northumbria--"'
479, 
480, 'Ugh!'
480, said
480, the
480, Lory,
480, with
480, a
480, shiver.
481, 
482, 'I
482, beg
482, your
482, pardon!'
482, said
482, the
482, Mouse,
482, frowning,
482, but
482, very
482, politely:
482, 'Did
483, you
483, speak?'
484, 
485, 'Not
485, I!'
485, said
485, the
485, Lory
485, hastily.
486, 
487, 'I
487, thought
487, you
487, did,'
487, said
487, the
487, Mouse.
487, '--I
487, proceed.
487, "Edwin
487, and
487, Morcar,
488, the
488, earls
488, of
488, Mercia
488, and
488, Northumbria,
488, declared
488, for
488, him:
488, and
488, even
488, Stigand,
489, the
489, patriotic
489, archbishop
489, of
489, Canterbury,
489, found
489, it
489, advisable--"'
490, 
491, 'Found
491, WHAT?'
491, said
491, the
491, Duck.
492, 
493, 'Found
493, IT,'
493, the
493, Mouse
493, replied
493, rather
493, crossly:
493, 'of
493, course
493, you
493, know
493, what
494, "it"
494, means.'
495, 
496, 'I
496, know
496, what
496, "it"
496, means
496, well
496, enough,
496, when
496, I
496, find
496, a
496, thing,'
496, said
496, the
497, Duck:
497, 'it's
497, generally
497, a
497, frog
497, or
497, a
497, worm.
497, The
497, question
497, is,
497, what
497, did
497, the
498, archbishop
498, find?'
499, 
500, The
500, Mouse
500, did
500, not
500, notice
500, this
500, question,
500, but
500, hurriedly
500, went
500, on,
500, '"--found
501, it
501, advisable
501, to
501, go
501, with
501, Edgar
501, Atheling
501, to
501, meet
501, William
501, and
501, offer
501, him
501, the
502, crown.
502, William's
502, conduct
502, at
502, first
502, was
502, moderate.
502, But
502, the
502, insolence
502, of
502, his
503, Normans--"
503, How
503, are
503, you
503, getting
503, on
503, now,
503, my
503, dear?'
503, it
503, continued,
503, turning
504, to
504, Alice
504, as
504, it
504, spoke.
505, 
506, 'As
506, wet
506, as
506, ever,'
506, said
506, Alice
506, in
506, a
506, melancholy
506, tone:
506, 'it
506, doesn't
506, seem
506, to
507, dry
507, me
507, at
507, all.'
508, 
509, 'In
509, that
509, case,'
509, said
509, the
509, Dodo
509, solemnly,
509, rising
509, to
509, its
509, feet,
509, 'I
509, move
510, that
510, the
510, meeting
510, adjourn,
510, for
510, the
510, immediate
510, adoption
510, of
510, more
510, energetic
511, remedies--'
512, 
513, 'Speak
513, English!'
513, said
513, the
513, Eaglet.
513, 'I
513, don't
513, know
513, the
513, meaning
513, of
513, half
514, those
514, long
514, words,
514, and,
514, what's
514, more,
514, I
514, don't
514, believe
514, you
514, do
514, either!'
514, And
515, the
515, Eaglet
515, bent
515, down
515, its
515, head
515, to
515, hide
515, a
515, smile:
515, some
515, of
515, the
515, other
515, birds
516, tittered
516, audibly.
517, 
518, 'What
518, I
518, was
518, going
518, to
518, say,'
518, said
518, the
518, Dodo
518, in
518, an
518, offended
518, tone,
518, 'was,
518, that
519, the
519, best
519, thing
519, to
519, get
519, us
519, dry
519, would
519, be
519, a
519, Caucus-race.'
520, 
521, 'What
521, IS
521, a
521, Caucus-race?'
521, said
521, Alice;
521, not
521, that
521, she
521, wanted
521, much
521, to
521, know,
522, but
522, the
522, Dodo
522, had
522, paused
522, as
522, if
522, it
522, thought
522, that
522, SOMEBODY
522, ought
522, to
522, speak,
523, and
523, no
523, one
523, else
523, seemed
523, inclined
523, to
523, say
523, anything.
524, 
525, 'Why,'
525, said
525, the
525, Dodo,
525, 'the
525, best
525, way
525, to
525, explain
525, it
525, is
525, to
525, do
525, it.'
525, (And,
525, as
526, you
526, might
526, like
526, to
526, try
526, the
526, thing
526, yourself,
526, some
526, winter
526, day,
526, I
526, will
526, tell
527, you
527, how
527, the
527, Dodo
527, managed
527, it.)
528, 
529, First
529, it
529, marked
529, out
529, a
529, race-course,
529, in
529, a
529, sort
529, of
529, circle,
529, ('the
529, exact
530, shape
530, doesn't
530, matter,'
530, it
530, said,)
530, and
530, then
530, all
530, the
530, party
530, were
530, placed
531, along
531, the
531, course,
531, here
531, and
531, there.
531, There
531, was
531, no
531, 'One,
531, two,
531, three,
531, and
532, away,'
532, but
532, they
532, began
532, running
532, when
532, they
532, liked,
532, and
532, left
532, off
532, when
532, they
533, liked,
533, so
533, that
533, it
533, was
533, not
533, easy
533, to
533, know
533, when
533, the
533, race
533, was
533, over.
533, However,
534, when
534, they
534, had
534, been
534, running
534, half
534, an
534, hour
534, or
534, so,
534, and
534, were
534, quite
534, dry
534, again,
535, the
535, Dodo
535, suddenly
535, called
535, out
535, 'The
535, race
535, is
535, over!'
535, and
535, they
535, all
535, crowded
536, round
536, it,
536, panting,
536, and
536, asking,
536, 'But
536, who
536, has
536, won?'
537, 
538, This
538, question
538, the
538, Dodo
538, could
538, not
538, answer
538, without
538, a
538, great
538, deal
538, of
538, thought,
539, and
539, it
539, sat
539, for
539, a
539, long
539, time
539, with
539, one
539, finger
539, pressed
539, upon
539, its
539, forehead
540, (the
540, position
540, in
540, which
540, you
540, usually
540, see
540, Shakespeare,
540, in
540, the
540, pictures
541, of
541, him),
541, while
541, the
541, rest
541, waited
541, in
541, silence.
541, At
541, last
541, the
541, Dodo
541, said,
542, 'EVERYBODY
542, has
542, won,
542, and
542, all
542, must
542, have
542, prizes.'
543, 
544, 'But
544, who
544, is
544, to
544, give
544, the
544, prizes?'
544, quite
544, a
544, chorus
544, of
544, voices
544, asked.
545, 
546, 'Why,
546, SHE,
546, of
546, course,'
546, said
546, the
546, Dodo,
546, pointing
546, to
546, Alice
546, with
546, one
546, finger;
547, and
547, the
547, whole
547, party
547, at
547, once
547, crowded
547, round
547, her,
547, calling
547, out
547, in
547, a
547, confused
548, way,
548, 'Prizes!
548, Prizes!'
549, 
550, Alice
550, had
550, no
550, idea
550, what
550, to
550, do,
550, and
550, in
550, despair
550, she
550, put
550, her
550, hand
550, in
550, her
551, pocket,
551, and
551, pulled
551, out
551, a
551, box
551, of
551, comfits,
551, (luckily
551, the
551, salt
551, water
551, had
552, not
552, got
552, into
552, it),
552, and
552, handed
552, them
552, round
552, as
552, prizes.
552, There
552, was
552, exactly
552, one
553, a-piece
553, all
553, round.
554, 
555, 'But
555, she
555, must
555, have
555, a
555, prize
555, herself,
555, you
555, know,'
555, said
555, the
555, Mouse.
556, 
557, 'Of
557, course,'
557, the
557, Dodo
557, replied
557, very
557, gravely.
557, 'What
557, else
557, have
557, you
557, got
557, in
558, your
558, pocket?'
558, he
558, went
558, on,
558, turning
558, to
558, Alice.
559, 
560, 'Only
560, a
560, thimble,'
560, said
560, Alice
560, sadly.
561, 
562, 'Hand
562, it
562, over
562, here,'
562, said
562, the
562, Dodo.
563, 
564, Then
564, they
564, all
564, crowded
564, round
564, her
564, once
564, more,
564, while
564, the
564, Dodo
564, solemnly
565, presented
565, the
565, thimble,
565, saying
565, 'We
565, beg
565, your
565, acceptance
565, of
565, this
565, elegant
566, thimble';
566, and,
566, when
566, it
566, had
566, finished
566, this
566, short
566, speech,
566, they
566, all
566, cheered.
567, 
568, Alice
568, thought
568, the
568, whole
568, thing
568, very
568, absurd,
568, but
568, they
568, all
568, looked
568, so
568, grave
569, that
569, she
569, did
569, not
569, dare
569, to
569, laugh;
569, and,
569, as
569, she
569, could
569, not
569, think
569, of
569, anything
570, to
570, say,
570, she
570, simply
570, bowed,
570, and
570, took
570, the
570, thimble,
570, looking
570, as
570, solemn
570, as
570, she
571, could.
572, 
573, The
573, next
573, thing
573, was
573, to
573, eat
573, the
573, comfits:
573, this
573, caused
573, some
573, noise
573, and
574, confusion,
574, as
574, the
574, large
574, birds
574, complained
574, that
574, they
574, could
574, not
574, taste
575, theirs,
575, and
575, the
575, small
575, ones
575, choked
575, and
575, had
575, to
575, be
575, patted
575, on
575, the
575, back.
576, However,
576, it
576, was
576, over
576, at
576, last,
576, and
576, they
576, sat
576, down
576, again
576, in
576, a
576, ring,
576, and
577, begged
577, the
577, Mouse
577, to
577, tell
577, them
577, something
577, more.
578, 
579, 'You
579, promised
579, to
579, tell
579, me
579, your
579, history,
579, you
579, know,'
579, said
579, Alice,
579, 'and
579, why
580, it
580, is
580, you
580, hate--C
580, and
580, D,'
580, she
580, added
580, in
580, a
580, whisper,
580, half
580, afraid
580, that
580, it
581, would
581, be
581, offended
581, again.
582, 
583, 'Mine
583, is
583, a
583, long
583, and
583, a
583, sad
583, tale!'
583, said
583, the
583, Mouse,
583, turning
583, to
583, Alice,
583, and
584, sighing.
585, 
586, 'It
586, IS
586, a
586, long
586, tail,
586, certainly,'
586, said
586, Alice,
586, looking
586, down
586, with
586, wonder
586, at
587, the
587, Mouse's
587, tail;
587, 'but
587, why
587, do
587, you
587, call
587, it
587, sad?'
587, And
587, she
587, kept
587, on
587, puzzling
588, about
588, it
588, while
588, the
588, Mouse
588, was
588, speaking,
588, so
588, that
588, her
588, idea
588, of
588, the
588, tale
588, was
589, something
589, like
589, this:--
590, 
591, 'Fury
591, said
591, to
591, a
592, mouse,
592, That
592, he
593, met
593, in
593, the
594, house,
595, "Let
595, us
596, both
596, go
596, to
597, law:
597, I
597, will
598, prosecute
599, YOU.--Come,
600, I'll
600, take
600, no
601, denial;
601, We
602, must
602, have
602, a
603, trial:
603, For
604, really
604, this
605, morning
605, I've
606, nothing
607, to
607, do."
608, Said
608, the
609, mouse
609, to
609, the
610, cur,
610, "Such
611, a
611, trial,
612, dear
612, Sir,
613, With
614, no
614, jury
615, or
615, judge,
616, would
616, be
617, wasting
618, our
619, breath."
620, "I'll
620, be
621, judge,
621, I'll
622, be
622, jury,"
623, Said
624, cunning
625, old
625, Fury:
626, "I'll
627, try
627, the
628, whole
629, cause,
630, and
631, condemn
632, you
633, to
634, death."'
635, 
636, 
637, 'You
637, are
637, not
637, attending!'
637, said
637, the
637, Mouse
637, to
637, Alice
637, severely.
637, 'What
637, are
637, you
638, thinking
638, of?'
639, 
640, 'I
640, beg
640, your
640, pardon,'
640, said
640, Alice
640, very
640, humbly:
640, 'you
640, had
640, got
640, to
640, the
640, fifth
641, bend,
641, I
641, think?'
642, 
643, 'I
643, had
643, NOT!'
643, cried
643, the
643, Mouse,
643, sharply
643, and
643, very
643, angrily.
644, 
645, 'A
645, knot!'
645, said
645, Alice,
645, always
645, ready
645, to
645, make
645, herself
645, useful,
645, and
645, looking
646, anxiously
646, about
646, her.
646, 'Oh,
646, do
646, let
646, me
646, help
646, to
646, undo
646, it!'
647, 
648, 'I
648, shall
648, do
648, nothing
648, of
648, the
648, sort,'
648, said
648, the
648, Mouse,
648, getting
648, up
648, and
648, walking
649, away.
649, 'You
649, insult
649, me
649, by
649, talking
649, such
649, nonsense!'
650, 
651, 'I
651, didn't
651, mean
651, it!'
651, pleaded
651, poor
651, Alice.
651, 'But
651, you're
651, so
651, easily
651, offended,
652, you
652, know!'
653, 
654, The
654, Mouse
654, only
654, growled
654, in
654, reply.
655, 
656, 'Please
656, come
656, back
656, and
656, finish
656, your
656, story!'
656, Alice
656, called
656, after
656, it;
656, and
656, the
657, others
657, all
657, joined
657, in
657, chorus,
657, 'Yes,
657, please
657, do!'
657, but
657, the
657, Mouse
657, only
657, shook
658, its
658, head
658, impatiently,
658, and
658, walked
658, a
658, little
658, quicker.
659, 
660, 'What
660, a
660, pity
660, it
660, wouldn't
660, stay!'
660, sighed
660, the
660, Lory,
660, as
660, soon
660, as
660, it
660, was
660, quite
661, out
661, of
661, sight;
661, and
661, an
661, old
661, Crab
661, took
661, the
661, opportunity
661, of
661, saying
661, to
661, her
662, daughter
662, 'Ah,
662, my
662, dear!
662, Let
662, this
662, be
662, a
662, lesson
662, to
662, you
662, never
662, to
662, lose
663, YOUR
663, temper!'
663, 'Hold
663, your
663, tongue,
663, Ma!'
663, said
663, the
663, young
663, Crab,
663, a
663, little
664, snappishly.
664, 'You're
664, enough
664, to
664, try
664, the
664, patience
664, of
664, an
664, oyster!'
665, 
666, 'I
666, wish
666, I
666, had
666, our
666, Dinah
666, here,
666, I
666, know
666, I
666, do!'
666, said
666, Alice
666, aloud,
666, addressing
667, nobody
667, in
667, particular.
667, 'She'd
667, soon
667, fetch
667, it
667, back!'
668, 
669, 'And
669, who
669, is
669, Dinah,
669, if
669, I
669, might
669, venture
669, to
669, ask
669, the
669, question?'
669, said
669, the
670, Lory.
671, 
672, Alice
672, replied
672, eagerly,
672, for
672, she
672, was
672, always
672, ready
672, to
672, talk
672, about
672, her
672, pet:
673, 'Dinah's
673, our
673, cat.
673, And
673, she's
673, such
673, a
673, capital
673, one
673, for
673, catching
673, mice
673, you
674, can't
674, think!
674, And
674, oh,
674, I
674, wish
674, you
674, could
674, see
674, her
674, after
674, the
674, birds!
674, Why,
675, she'll
675, eat
675, a
675, little
675, bird
675, as
675, soon
675, as
675, look
675, at
675, it!'
676, 
677, This
677, speech
677, caused
677, a
677, remarkable
677, sensation
677, among
677, the
677, party.
677, Some
677, of
677, the
678, birds
678, hurried
678, off
678, at
678, once:
678, one
678, old
678, Magpie
678, began
678, wrapping
678, itself
678, up
678, very
679, carefully,
679, remarking,
679, 'I
679, really
679, must
679, be
679, getting
679, home;
679, the
679, night-air
680, doesn't
680, suit
680, my
680, throat!'
680, and
680, a
680, Canary
680, called
680, out
680, in
680, a
680, trembling
680, voice
680, to
681, its
681, children,
681, 'Come
681, away,
681, my
681, dears!
681, It's
681, high
681, time
681, you
681, were
681, all
681, in
681, bed!'
682, On
682, various
682, pretexts
682, they
682, all
682, moved
682, off,
682, and
682, Alice
682, was
682, soon
682, left
682, alone.
683, 
684, 'I
684, wish
684, I
684, hadn't
684, mentioned
684, Dinah!'
684, she
684, said
684, to
684, herself
684, in
684, a
684, melancholy
685, tone.
685, 'Nobody
685, seems
685, to
685, like
685, her,
685, down
685, here,
685, and
685, I'm
685, sure
685, she's
685, the
685, best
686, cat
686, in
686, the
686, world!
686, Oh,
686, my
686, dear
686, Dinah!
686, I
686, wonder
686, if
686, I
686, shall
686, ever
686, see
686, you
687, any
687, more!'
687, And
687, here
687, poor
687, Alice
687, began
687, to
687, cry
687, again,
687, for
687, she
687, felt
687, very
688, lonely
688, and
688, low-spirited.
688, In
688, a
688, little
688, while,
688, however,
688, she
688, again
688, heard
689, a
689, little
689, pattering
689, of
689, footsteps
689, in
689, the
689, distance,
689, and
689, she
689, looked
689, up
690, eagerly,
690, half
690, hoping
690, that
690, the
690, Mouse
690, had
690, changed
690, his
690, mind,
690, and
690, was
690, coming
691, back
691, to
691, finish
691, his
691, story.
692, 
693, 
694, 
695, 
696, CHAPTER
696, IV.
696, The
696, Rabbit
696, Sends
696, in
696, a
696, Little
696, Bill
697, 
698, It
698, was
698, the
698, White
698, Rabbit,
698, trotting
698, slowly
698, back
698, again,
698, and
698, looking
699, anxiously
699, about
699, as
699, it
699, went,
699, as
699, if
699, it
699, had
699, lost
699, something;
699, and
699, she
699, heard
700, it
700, muttering
700, to
700, itself
700, 'The
700, Duchess!
700, The
700, Duchess!
700, Oh
700, my
700, dear
700, paws!
700, Oh
701, my
701, fur
701, and
701, whiskers!
701, She'll
701, get
701, me
701, executed,
701, as
701, sure
701, as
701, ferrets
701, are
702, ferrets!
702, Where
702, CAN
702, I
702, have
702, dropped
702, them,
702, I
702, wonder?'
702, Alice
702, guessed
702, in
702, a
703, moment
703, that
703, it
703, was
703, looking
703, for
703, the
703, fan
703, and
703, the
703, pair
703, of
703, white
703, kid
703, gloves,
704, and
704, she
704, very
704, good-naturedly
704, began
704, hunting
704, about
704, for
704, them,
704, but
704, they
704, were
705, nowhere
705, to
705, be
705, seen--everything
705, seemed
705, to
705, have
705, changed
705, since
705, her
705, swim
705, in
706, the
706, pool,
706, and
706, the
706, great
706, hall,
706, with
706, the
706, glass
706, table
706, and
706, the
706, little
706, door,
707, had
707, vanished
707, completely.
708, 
709, Very
709, soon
709, the
709, Rabbit
709, noticed
709, Alice,
709, as
709, she
709, went
709, hunting
709, about,
709, and
710, called
710, out
710, to
710, her
710, in
710, an
710, angry
710, tone,
710, 'Why,
710, Mary
710, Ann,
710, what
710, ARE
710, you
710, doing
711, out
711, here?
711, Run
711, home
711, this
711, moment,
711, and
711, fetch
711, me
711, a
711, pair
711, of
711, gloves
711, and
711, a
711, fan!
712, Quick,
712, now!'
712, And
712, Alice
712, was
712, so
712, much
712, frightened
712, that
712, she
712, ran
712, off
712, at
712, once
713, in
713, the
713, direction
713, it
713, pointed
713, to,
713, without
713, trying
713, to
713, explain
713, the
713, mistake
713, it
714, had
714, made.
715, 
716, 'He
716, took
716, me
716, for
716, his
716, housemaid,'
716, she
716, said
716, to
716, herself
716, as
716, she
716, ran.
716, 'How
717, surprised
717, he'll
717, be
717, when
717, he
717, finds
717, out
717, who
717, I
717, am!
717, But
717, I'd
717, better
717, take
717, him
718, his
718, fan
718, and
718, gloves--that
718, is,
718, if
718, I
718, can
718, find
718, them.'
718, As
718, she
718, said
718, this,
718, she
719, came
719, upon
719, a
719, neat
719, little
719, house,
719, on
719, the
719, door
719, of
719, which
719, was
719, a
719, bright
719, brass
720, plate
720, with
720, the
720, name
720, 'W.
720, RABBIT'
720, engraved
720, upon
720, it.
720, She
720, went
720, in
720, without
721, knocking,
721, and
721, hurried
721, upstairs,
721, in
721, great
721, fear
721, lest
721, she
721, should
721, meet
721, the
722, real
722, Mary
722, Ann,
722, and
722, be
722, turned
722, out
722, of
722, the
722, house
722, before
722, she
722, had
722, found
722, the
723, fan
723, and
723, gloves.
724, 
725, 'How
725, queer
725, it
725, seems,'
725, Alice
725, said
725, to
725, herself,
725, 'to
725, be
725, going
725, messages
725, for
726, a
726, rabbit!
726, I
726, suppose
726, Dinah'll
726, be
726, sending
726, me
726, on
726, messages
726, next!'
726, And
726, she
727, began
727, fancying
727, the
727, sort
727, of
727, thing
727, that
727, would
727, happen:
727, '"Miss
727, Alice!
727, Come
728, here
728, directly,
728, and
728, get
728, ready
728, for
728, your
728, walk!"
728, "Coming
728, in
728, a
728, minute,
729, nurse!
729, But
729, I've
729, got
729, to
729, see
729, that
729, the
729, mouse
729, doesn't
729, get
729, out."
729, Only
729, I
729, don't
730, think,'
730, Alice
730, went
730, on,
730, 'that
730, they'd
730, let
730, Dinah
730, stop
730, in
730, the
730, house
730, if
730, it
731, began
731, ordering
731, people
731, about
731, like
731, that!'
732, 
733, By
733, this
733, time
733, she
733, had
733, found
733, her
733, way
733, into
733, a
733, tidy
733, little
733, room
733, with
733, a
733, table
734, in
734, the
734, window,
734, and
734, on
734, it
734, (as
734, she
734, had
734, hoped)
734, a
734, fan
734, and
734, two
734, or
734, three
734, pairs
735, of
735, tiny
735, white
735, kid
735, gloves:
735, she
735, took
735, up
735, the
735, fan
735, and
735, a
735, pair
735, of
735, the
735, gloves,
736, and
736, was
736, just
736, going
736, to
736, leave
736, the
736, room,
736, when
736, her
736, eye
736, fell
736, upon
736, a
736, little
737, bottle
737, that
737, stood
737, near
737, the
737, looking-glass.
737, There
737, was
737, no
737, label
737, this
737, time
738, with
738, the
738, words
738, 'DRINK
738, ME,'
738, but
738, nevertheless
738, she
738, uncorked
738, it
738, and
738, put
738, it
739, to
739, her
739, lips.
739, 'I
739, know
739, SOMETHING
739, interesting
739, is
739, sure
739, to
739, happen,'
739, she
739, said
740, to
740, herself,
740, 'whenever
740, I
740, eat
740, or
740, drink
740, anything;
740, so
740, I'll
740, just
740, see
740, what
741, this
741, bottle
741, does.
741, I
741, do
741, hope
741, it'll
741, make
741, me
741, grow
741, large
741, again,
741, for
741, really
742, I'm
742, quite
742, tired
742, of
742, being
742, such
742, a
742, tiny
742, little
742, thing!'
743, 
744, It
744, did
744, so
744, indeed,
744, and
744, much
744, sooner
744, than
744, she
744, had
744, expected:
744, before
744, she
744, had
745, drunk
745, half
745, the
745, bottle,
745, she
745, found
745, her
745, head
745, pressing
745, against
745, the
745, ceiling,
746, and
746, had
746, to
746, stoop
746, to
746, save
746, her
746, neck
746, from
746, being
746, broken.
746, She
746, hastily
746, put
747, down
747, the
747, bottle,
747, saying
747, to
747, herself
747, 'That's
747, quite
747, enough--I
747, hope
747, I
747, shan't
748, grow
748, any
748, more--As
748, it
748, is,
748, I
748, can't
748, get
748, out
748, at
748, the
748, door--I
748, do
748, wish
748, I
748, hadn't
749, drunk
749, quite
749, so
749, much!'
750, 
751, Alas!
751, it
751, was
751, too
751, late
751, to
751, wish
751, that!
751, She
751, went
751, on
751, growing,
751, and
751, growing,
752, and
752, very
752, soon
752, had
752, to
752, kneel
752, down
752, on
752, the
752, floor:
752, in
752, another
752, minute
752, there
753, was
753, not
753, even
753, room
753, for
753, this,
753, and
753, she
753, tried
753, the
753, effect
753, of
753, lying
753, down
753, with
754, one
754, elbow
754, against
754, the
754, door,
754, and
754, the
754, other
754, arm
754, curled
754, round
754, her
754, head.
755, Still
755, she
755, went
755, on
755, growing,
755, and,
755, as
755, a
755, last
755, resource,
755, she
755, put
755, one
755, arm
755, out
756, of
756, the
756, window,
756, and
756, one
756, foot
756, up
756, the
756, chimney,
756, and
756, said
756, to
756, herself
756, 'Now
756, I
757, can
757, do
757, no
757, more,
757, whatever
757, happens.
757, What
757, WILL
757, become
757, of
757, me?'
758, 
759, Luckily
759, for
759, Alice,
759, the
759, little
759, magic
759, bottle
759, had
759, now
759, had
759, its
759, full
759, effect,
760, and
760, she
760, grew
760, no
760, larger:
760, still
760, it
760, was
760, very
760, uncomfortable,
760, and,
760, as
760, there
761, seemed
761, to
761, be
761, no
761, sort
761, of
761, chance
761, of
761, her
761, ever
761, getting
761, out
761, of
761, the
761, room
762, again,
762, no
762, wonder
762, she
762, felt
762, unhappy.
763, 
764, 'It
764, was
764, much
764, pleasanter
764, at
764, home,'
764, thought
764, poor
764, Alice,
764, 'when
764, one
764, wasn't
765, always
765, growing
765, larger
765, and
765, smaller,
765, and
765, being
765, ordered
765, about
765, by
765, mice
765, and
766, rabbits.
766, I
766, almost
766, wish
766, I
766, hadn't
766, gone
766, down
766, that
766, rabbit-hole--and
766, yet--and
767, yet--it's
767, rather
767, curious,
767, you
767, know,
767, this
767, sort
767, of
767, life!
767, I
767, do
767, wonder
767, what
768, CAN
768, have
768, happened
768, to
768, me!
768, When
768, I
768, used
768, to
768, read
768, fairy-tales,
768, I
768, fancied
768, that
769, kind
769, of
769, thing
769, never
769, happened,
769, and
769, now
769, here
769, I
769, am
769, in
769, the
769, middle
769, of
769, one!
770, There
770, ought
770, to
770, be
770, a
770, book
770, written
770, about
770, me,
770, that
770, there
770, ought!
770, And
770, when
770, I
771, grow
771, up,
771, I'll
771, write
771, one--but
771, I'm
771, grown
771, up
771, now,'
771, she
771, added
771, in
771, a
771, sorrowful
772, tone;
772, 'at
772, least
772, there's
772, no
772, room
772, to
772, grow
772, up
772, any
772, more
772, HERE.'
773, 
774, 'But
774, then,'
774, thought
774, Alice,
774, 'shall
774, I
774, NEVER
774, get
774, any
774, older
774, than
774, I
774, am
775, now?
775, That'll
775, be
775, a
775, comfort,
775, one
775, way--never
775, to
775, be
775, an
775, old
775, woman--but
776, then--always
776, to
776, have
776, lessons
776, to
776, learn!
776, Oh,
776, I
776, shouldn't
776, like
776, THAT!'
777, 
778, 'Oh,
778, you
778, foolish
778, Alice!'
778, she
778, answered
778, herself.
778, 'How
778, can
778, you
778, learn
779, lessons
779, in
779, here?
779, Why,
779, there's
779, hardly
779, room
779, for
779, YOU,
779, and
779, no
779, room
779, at
779, all
780, for
780, any
780, lesson-books!'
781, 
782, And
782, so
782, she
782, went
782, on,
782, taking
782, first
782, one
782, side
782, and
782, then
782, the
782, other,
782, and
782, making
783, quite
783, a
783, conversation
783, of
783, it
783, altogether;
783, but
783, after
783, a
783, few
783, minutes
783, she
783, heard
784, a
784, voice
784, outside,
784, and
784, stopped
784, to
784, listen.
785, 
786, 'Mary
786, Ann!
786, Mary
786, Ann!'
786, said
786, the
786, voice.
786, 'Fetch
786, me
786, my
786, gloves
786, this
786, moment!'
787, Then
787, came
787, a
787, little
787, pattering
787, of
787, feet
787, on
787, the
787, stairs.
787, Alice
787, knew
787, it
787, was
788, the
788, Rabbit
788, coming
788, to
788, look
788, for
788, her,
788, and
788, she
788, trembled
788, till
788, she
788, shook
788, the
789, house,
789, quite
789, forgetting
789, that
789, she
789, was
789, now
789, about
789, a
789, thousand
789, times
789, as
789, large
790, as
790, the
790, Rabbit,
790, and
790, had
790, no
790, reason
790, to
790, be
790, afraid
790, of
790, it.
791, 
792, Presently
792, the
792, Rabbit
792, came
792, up
792, to
792, the
792, door,
792, and
792, tried
792, to
792, open
792, it;
792, but,
792, as
793, the
793, door
793, opened
793, inwards,
793, and
793, Alice's
793, elbow
793, was
793, pressed
793, hard
793, against
793, it,
794, that
794, attempt
794, proved
794, a
794, failure.
794, Alice
794, heard
794, it
794, say
794, to
794, itself
794, 'Then
794, I'll
795, go
795, round
795, and
795, get
795, in
795, at
795, the
795, window.'
796, 
797, 'THAT
797, you
797, won't'
797, thought
797, Alice,
797, and,
797, after
797, waiting
797, till
797, she
797, fancied
798, she
798, heard
798, the
798, Rabbit
798, just
798, under
798, the
798, window,
798, she
798, suddenly
798, spread
798, out
798, her
799, hand,
799, and
799, made
799, a
799, snatch
799, in
799, the
799, air.
799, She
799, did
799, not
799, get
799, hold
799, of
799, anything,
800, but
800, she
800, heard
800, a
800, little
800, shriek
800, and
800, a
800, fall,
800, and
800, a
800, crash
800, of
800, broken
800, glass,
801, from
801, which
801, she
801, concluded
801, that
801, it
801, was
801, just
801, possible
801, it
801, had
801, fallen
801, into
801, a
802, cucumber-frame,
802, or
802, something
802, of
802, the
802, sort.
803, 
804, Next
804, came
804, an
804, angry
804, voice--the
804, Rabbit's--'Pat!
804, Pat!
804, Where
804, are
804, you?'
804, And
805, then
805, a
805, voice
805, she
805, had
805, never
805, heard
805, before,
805, 'Sure
805, then
805, I'm
805, here!
805, Digging
806, for
806, apples,
806, yer
806, honour!'
807, 
808, 'Digging
808, for
808, apples,
808, indeed!'
808, said
808, the
808, Rabbit
808, angrily.
808, 'Here!
808, Come
808, and
809, help
809, me
809, out
809, of
809, THIS!'
809, (Sounds
809, of
809, more
809, broken
809, glass.)
810, 
811, 'Now
811, tell
811, me,
811, Pat,
811, what's
811, that
811, in
811, the
811, window?'
812, 
813, 'Sure,
813, it's
813, an
813, arm,
813, yer
813, honour!'
813, (He
813, pronounced
813, it
813, 'arrum.')
814, 
815, 'An
815, arm,
815, you
815, goose!
815, Who
815, ever
815, saw
815, one
815, that
815, size?
815, Why,
815, it
815, fills
815, the
815, whole
816, window!'
817, 
818, 'Sure,
818, it
818, does,
818, yer
818, honour:
818, but
818, it's
818, an
818, arm
818, for
818, all
818, that.'
819, 
820, 'Well,
820, it's
820, got
820, no
820, business
820, there,
820, at
820, any
820, rate:
820, go
820, and
820, take
820, it
820, away!'
821, 
822, There
822, was
822, a
822, long
822, silence
822, after
822, this,
822, and
822, Alice
822, could
822, only
822, hear
822, whispers
823, now
823, and
823, then;
823, such
823, as,
823, 'Sure,
823, I
823, don't
823, like
823, it,
823, yer
823, honour,
823, at
823, all,
823, at
824, all!'
824, 'Do
824, as
824, I
824, tell
824, you,
824, you
824, coward!'
824, and
824, at
824, last
824, she
824, spread
824, out
824, her
825, hand
825, again,
825, and
825, made
825, another
825, snatch
825, in
825, the
825, air.
825, This
825, time
825, there
825, were
826, TWO
826, little
826, shrieks,
826, and
826, more
826, sounds
826, of
826, broken
826, glass.
826, 'What
826, a
826, number
826, of
827, cucumber-frames
827, there
827, must
827, be!'
827, thought
827, Alice.
827, 'I
827, wonder
827, what
827, they'll
827, do
828, next!
828, As
828, for
828, pulling
828, me
828, out
828, of
828, the
828, window,
828, I
828, only
828, wish
828, they
828, COULD!
828, I'm
829, sure
829, I
829, don't
829, want
829, to
829, stay
829, in
829, here
829, any
829, longer!'
830, 
831, She
831, waited
831, for
831, some
831, time
831, without
831, hearing
831, anything
831, more:
831, at
831, last
831, came
831, a
832, rumbling
832, of
832, little
832, cartwheels,
832, and
832, the
832, sound
832, of
832, a
832, good
832, many
832, voices
833, all
833, talking
833, together:
833, she
833, made
833, out
833, the
833, words:
833, 'Where's
833, the
833, other
834, ladder?--Why,
834, I
834, hadn't
834, to
834, bring
834, but
834, one;
834, Bill's
834, got
834, the
834, other--Bill!
835, fetch
835, it
835, here,
835, lad!--Here,
835, put
835, 'em
835, up
835, at
835, this
835, corner--No,
835, tie
835, 'em
836, together
836, first--they
836, don't
836, reach
836, half
836, high
836, enough
836, yet--Oh!
836, they'll
837, do
837, well
837, enough;
837, don't
837, be
837, particular--Here,
837, Bill!
837, catch
837, hold
837, of
837, this
838, rope--Will
838, the
838, roof
838, bear?--Mind
838, that
838, loose
838, slate--Oh,
838, it's
838, coming
839, down!
839, Heads
839, below!'
839, (a
839, loud
839, crash)--'Now,
839, who
839, did
839, that?--It
839, was
839, Bill,
839, I
840, fancy--Who's
840, to
840, go
840, down
840, the
840, chimney?--Nay,
840, I
840, shan't!
840, YOU
840, do
840, it!--That
840, I
841, won't,
841, then!--Bill's
841, to
841, go
841, down--Here,
841, Bill!
841, the
841, master
841, says
841, you're
841, to
842, go
842, down
842, the
842, chimney!'
843, 
844, 'Oh!
844, So
844, Bill's
844, got
844, to
844, come
844, down
844, the
844, chimney,
844, has
844, he?'
844, said
844, Alice
844, to
845, herself.
845, 'Shy,
845, they
845, seem
845, to
845, put
845, everything
845, upon
845, Bill!
845, I
845, wouldn't
845, be
845, in
846, Bill's
846, place
846, for
846, a
846, good
846, deal:
846, this
846, fireplace
846, is
846, narrow,
846, to
846, be
846, sure;
846, but
847, I
847, THINK
847, I
847, can
847, kick
847, a
847, little!'
848, 
849, She
849, drew
849, her
849, foot
849, as
849, far
849, down
849, the
849, chimney
849, as
849, she
849, could,
849, and
849, waited
850, till
850, she
850, heard
850, a
850, little
850, animal
850, (she
850, couldn't
850, guess
850, of
850, what
850, sort
850, it
850, was)
851, scratching
851, and
851, scrambling
851, about
851, in
851, the
851, chimney
851, close
851, above
851, her:
851, then,
852, saying
852, to
852, herself
852, 'This
852, is
852, Bill,'
852, she
852, gave
852, one
852, sharp
852, kick,
852, and
852, waited
852, to
853, see
853, what
853, would
853, happen
853, next.
854, 
855, The
855, first
855, thing
855, she
855, heard
855, was
855, a
855, general
855, chorus
855, of
855, 'There
855, goes
855, Bill!'
856, then
856, the
856, Rabbit's
856, voice
856, along--'Catch
856, him,
856, you
856, by
856, the
856, hedge!'
856, then
857, silence,
857, and
857, then
857, another
857, confusion
857, of
857, voices--'Hold
857, up
857, his
857, head--Brandy
858, now--Don't
858, choke
858, him--How
858, was
858, it,
858, old
858, fellow?
858, What
858, happened
858, to
858, you?
858, Tell
859, us
859, all
859, about
859, it!'
860, 
861, Last
861, came
861, a
861, little
861, feeble,
861, squeaking
861, voice,
861, ('That's
861, Bill,'
861, thought
862, Alice,)
862, 'Well,
862, I
862, hardly
862, know--No
862, more,
862, thank
862, ye;
862, I'm
862, better
862, now--but
862, I'm
863, a
863, deal
863, too
863, flustered
863, to
863, tell
863, you--all
863, I
863, know
863, is,
863, something
863, comes
863, at
863, me
864, like
864, a
864, Jack-in-the-box,
864, and
864, up
864, I
864, goes
864, like
864, a
864, sky-rocket!'
865, 
866, 'So
866, you
866, did,
866, old
866, fellow!'
866, said
866, the
866, others.
867, 
868, 'We
868, must
868, burn
868, the
868, house
868, down!'
868, said
868, the
868, Rabbit's
868, voice;
868, and
868, Alice
868, called
869, out
869, as
869, loud
869, as
869, she
869, could,
869, 'If
869, you
869, do.
869, I'll
869, set
869, Dinah
869, at
869, you!'
870, 
871, There
871, was
871, a
871, dead
871, silence
871, instantly,
871, and
871, Alice
871, thought
871, to
871, herself,
871, 'I
872, wonder
872, what
872, they
872, WILL
872, do
872, next!
872, If
872, they
872, had
872, any
872, sense,
872, they'd
872, take
872, the
873, roof
873, off.'
873, After
873, a
873, minute
873, or
873, two,
873, they
873, began
873, moving
873, about
873, again,
873, and
874, Alice
874, heard
874, the
874, Rabbit
874, say,
874, 'A
874, barrowful
874, will
874, do,
874, to
874, begin
874, with.'
875, 
876, 'A
876, barrowful
876, of
876, WHAT?'
876, thought
876, Alice;
876, but
876, she
876, had
876, not
876, long
876, to
876, doubt,
877, for
877, the
877, next
877, moment
877, a
877, shower
877, of
877, little
877, pebbles
877, came
877, rattling
877, in
877, at
877, the
878, window,
878, and
878, some
878, of
878, them
878, hit
878, her
878, in
878, the
878, face.
878, 'I'll
878, put
878, a
878, stop
878, to
878, this,'
879, she
879, said
879, to
879, herself,
879, and
879, shouted
879, out,
879, 'You'd
879, better
879, not
879, do
879, that
879, again!'
880, which
880, produced
880, another
880, dead
880, silence.
881, 
882, Alice
882, noticed
882, with
882, some
882, surprise
882, that
882, the
882, pebbles
882, were
882, all
882, turning
882, into
883, little
883, cakes
883, as
883, they
883, lay
883, on
883, the
883, floor,
883, and
883, a
883, bright
883, idea
883, came
883, into
883, her
884, head.
884, 'If
884, I
884, eat
884, one
884, of
884, these
884, cakes,'
884, she
884, thought,
884, 'it's
884, sure
884, to
884, make
885, SOME
885, change
885, in
885, my
885, size;
885, and
885, as
885, it
885, can't
885, possibly
885, make
885, me
885, larger,
885, it
885, must
886, make
886, me
886, smaller,
886, I
886, suppose.'
887, 
888, So
888, she
888, swallowed
888, one
888, of
888, the
888, cakes,
888, and
888, was
888, delighted
888, to
888, find
888, that
888, she
889, began
889, shrinking
889, directly.
889, As
889, soon
889, as
889, she
889, was
889, small
889, enough
889, to
889, get
889, through
890, the
890, door,
890, she
890, ran
890, out
890, of
890, the
890, house,
890, and
890, found
890, quite
890, a
890, crowd
890, of
890, little
891, animals
891, and
891, birds
891, waiting
891, outside.
891, The
891, poor
891, little
891, Lizard,
891, Bill,
891, was
892, in
892, the
892, middle,
892, being
892, held
892, up
892, by
892, two
892, guinea-pigs,
892, who
892, were
892, giving
892, it
893, something
893, out
893, of
893, a
893, bottle.
893, They
893, all
893, made
893, a
893, rush
893, at
893, Alice
893, the
893, moment
893, she
894, appeared;
894, but
894, she
894, ran
894, off
894, as
894, hard
894, as
894, she
894, could,
894, and
894, soon
894, found
894, herself
895, safe
895, in
895, a
895, thick
895, wood.
896, 
897, 'The
897, first
897, thing
897, I've
897, got
897, to
897, do,'
897, said
897, Alice
897, to
897, herself,
897, as
897, she
897, wandered
898, about
898, in
898, the
898, wood,
898, 'is
898, to
898, grow
898, to
898, my
898, right
898, size
898, again;
898, and
898, the
898, second
899, thing
899, is
899, to
899, find
899, my
899, way
899, into
899, that
899, lovely
899, garden.
899, I
899, think
899, that
899, will
899, be
900, the
900, best
900, plan.'
901, 
902, It
902, sounded
902, an
902, excellent
902, plan,
902, no
902, doubt,
902, and
902, very
902, neatly
902, and
902, simply
903, arranged;
903, the
903, only
903, difficulty
903, was,
903, that
903, she
903, had
903, not
903, the
903, smallest
903, idea
904, how
904, to
904, set
904, about
904, it;
904, and
904, while
904, she
904, was
904, peering
904, about
904, anxiously
904, among
905, the
905, trees,
905, a
905, little
905, sharp
905, bark
905, just
905, over
905, her
905, head
905, made
905, her
905, look
905, up
905, in
905, a
906, great
906, hurry.
907, 
908, An
908, enormous
908, puppy
908, was
908, looking
908, down
908, at
908, her
908, with
908, large
908, round
908, eyes,
908, and
909, feebly
909, stretching
909, out
909, one
909, paw,
909, trying
909, to
909, touch
909, her.
909, 'Poor
909, little
909, thing!'
910, said
910, Alice,
910, in
910, a
910, coaxing
910, tone,
910, and
910, she
910, tried
910, hard
910, to
910, whistle
910, to
910, it;
910, but
911, she
911, was
911, terribly
911, frightened
911, all
911, the
911, time
911, at
911, the
911, thought
911, that
911, it
911, might
911, be
912, hungry,
912, in
912, which
912, case
912, it
912, would
912, be
912, very
912, likely
912, to
912, eat
912, her
912, up
912, in
912, spite
912, of
913, all
913, her
913, coaxing.
914, 
915, Hardly
915, knowing
915, what
915, she
915, did,
915, she
915, picked
915, up
915, a
915, little
915, bit
915, of
915, stick,
915, and
916, held
916, it
916, out
916, to
916, the
916, puppy;
916, whereupon
916, the
916, puppy
916, jumped
916, into
916, the
916, air
916, off
917, all
917, its
917, feet
917, at
917, once,
917, with
917, a
917, yelp
917, of
917, delight,
917, and
917, rushed
917, at
917, the
917, stick,
918, and
918, made
918, believe
918, to
918, worry
918, it;
918, then
918, Alice
918, dodged
918, behind
918, a
918, great
918, thistle,
919, to
919, keep
919, herself
919, from
919, being
919, run
919, over;
919, and
919, the
919, moment
919, she
919, appeared
919, on
919, the
920, other
920, side,
920, the
920, puppy
920, made
920, another
920, rush
920, at
920, the
920, stick,
920, and
920, tumbled
920, head
921, over
921, heels
921, in
921, its
921, hurry
921, to
921, get
921, hold
921, of
921, it;
921, then
921, Alice,
921, thinking
921, it
921, was
922, very
922, like
922, having
922, a
922, game
922, of
922, play
922, with
922, a
922, cart-horse,
922, and
922, expecting
922, every
923, moment
923, to
923, be
923, trampled
923, under
923, its
923, feet,
923, ran
923, round
923, the
923, thistle
923, again;
923, then
924, the
924, puppy
924, began
924, a
924, series
924, of
924, short
924, charges
924, at
924, the
924, stick,
924, running
924, a
924, very
925, little
925, way
925, forwards
925, each
925, time
925, and
925, a
925, long
925, way
925, back,
925, and
925, barking
925, hoarsely
926, all
926, the
926, while,
926, till
926, at
926, last
926, it
926, sat
926, down
926, a
926, good
926, way
926, off,
926, panting,
926, with
927, its
927, tongue
927, hanging
927, out
927, of
927, its
927, mouth,
927, and
927, its
927, great
927, eyes
927, half
927, shut.
928, 
929, This
929, seemed
929, to
929, Alice
929, a
929, good
929, opportunity
929, for
929, making
929, her
929, escape;
929, so
929, she
930, set
930, off
930, at
930, once,
930, and
930, ran
930, till
930, she
930, was
930, quite
930, tired
930, and
930, out
930, of
930, breath,
930, and
931, till
931, the
931, puppy's
931, bark
931, sounded
931, quite
931, faint
931, in
931, the
931, distance.
932, 
933, 'And
933, yet
933, what
933, a
933, dear
933, little
933, puppy
933, it
933, was!'
933, said
933, Alice,
933, as
933, she
933, leant
934, against
934, a
934, buttercup
934, to
934, rest
934, herself,
934, and
934, fanned
934, herself
934, with
934, one
934, of
934, the
935, leaves:
935, 'I
935, should
935, have
935, liked
935, teaching
935, it
935, tricks
935, very
935, much,
935, if--if
935, I'd
936, only
936, been
936, the
936, right
936, size
936, to
936, do
936, it!
936, Oh
936, dear!
936, I'd
936, nearly
936, forgotten
936, that
937, I've
937, got
937, to
937, grow
937, up
937, again!
937, Let
937, me
937, see--how
937, IS
937, it
937, to
937, be
937, managed?
937, I
938, suppose
938, I
938, ought
938, to
938, eat
938, or
938, drink
938, something
938, or
938, other;
938, but
938, the
938, great
939, question
939, is,
939, what?'
940, 
941, The
941, great
941, question
941, certainly
941, was,
941, what?
941, Alice
941, looked
941, all
941, round
941, her
941, at
942, the
942, flowers
942, and
942, the
942, blades
942, of
942, grass,
942, but
942, she
942, did
942, not
942, see
942, anything
942, that
943, looked
943, like
943, the
943, right
943, thing
943, to
943, eat
943, or
943, drink
943, under
943, the
943, circumstances.
944, There
944, was
944, a
944, large
944, mushroom
944, growing
944, near
944, her,
944, about
944, the
944, same
944, height
944, as
945, herself;
945, and
945, when
945, she
945, had
945, looked
945, under
945, it,
945, and
945, on
945, both
945, sides
945, of
945, it,
945, and
946, behind
946, it,
946, it
946, occurred
946, to
946, her
946, that
946, she
946, might
946, as
946, well
946, look
946, and
946, see
946, what
947, was
947, on
947, the
947, top
947, of
947, it.
948, 
949, She
949, stretched
949, herself
949, up
949, on
949, tiptoe,
949, and
949, peeped
949, over
949, the
949, edge
949, of
949, the
950, mushroom,
950, and
950, her
950, eyes
950, immediately
950, met
950, those
950, of
950, a
950, large
950, caterpillar,
951, that
951, was
951, sitting
951, on
951, the
951, top
951, with
951, its
951, arms
951, folded,
951, quietly
951, smoking
951, a
951, long
952, hookah,
952, and
952, taking
952, not
952, the
952, smallest
952, notice
952, of
952, her
952, or
952, of
952, anything
952, else.
953, 
954,

957, CHAPTER
957, V.
957, Advice
957, from
957, a
957, Caterpillar
958, 
959, The
959, Caterpillar
959, and
959, Alice
959, looked
959, at
959, each
959, other
959, for
959, some
959, time
959, in
959, silence:
960, at
960, last
960, the
960, Caterpillar
960, took
960, the
960, hookah
960, out
960, of
960, its
960, mouth,
960, and
960, addressed
961, her
961, in
961, a
961, languid,
961, sleepy
961, voice.
962, 
963, 'Who
963, are
963, YOU?'
963, said
963, the
963, Caterpillar.
964, 
965, This
965, was
965, not
965, an
965, encouraging
965, opening
965, for
965, a
965, conversation.
965, Alice
965, replied,
966, rather
966, shyly,
966, 'I--I
966, hardly
966, know,
966, sir,
966, just
966, at
966, present--at
966, least
966, I
966, know
967, who
967, I
967, WAS
967, when
967, I
967, got
967, up
967, this
967, morning,
967, but
967, I
967, think
967, I
967, must
967, have
967, been
968, changed
968, several
968, times
968, since
968, then.'
969, 
970, 'What
970, do
970, you
970, mean
970, by
970, that?'
970, said
970, the
970, Caterpillar
970, sternly.
970, 'Explain
971, yourself!'
972, 
973, 'I
973, can't
973, explain
973, MYSELF,
973, I'm
973, afraid,
973, sir'
973, said
973, Alice,
973, 'because
973, I'm
973, not
974, myself,
974, you
974, see.'
975, 
976, 'I
976, don't
976, see,'
976, said
976, the
976, Caterpillar.
977, 
978, 'I'm
978, afraid
978, I
978, can't
978, put
978, it
978, more
978, clearly,'
978, Alice
978, replied
978, very
978, politely,
979, 'for
979, I
979, can't
979, understand
979, it
979, myself
979, to
979, begin
979, with;
979, and
979, being
979, so
979, many
980, different
980, sizes
980, in
980, a
980, day
980, is
980, very
980, confusing.'
981, 
982, 'It
982, isn't,'
982, said
982, the
982, Caterpillar.
983, 
984, 'Well,
984, perhaps
984, you
984, haven't
984, found
984, it
984, so
984, yet,'
984, said
984, Alice;
984, 'but
984, when
984, you
985, have
985, to
985, turn
985, into
985, a
985, chrysalis--you
985, will
985, some
985, day,
985, you
985, know--and
985, then
986, after
986, that
986, into
986, a
986, butterfly,
986, I
986, should
986, think
986, you'll
986, feel
986, it
986, a
986, little
987, queer,
987, won't
987, you?'
988, 
989, 'Not
989, a
989, bit,'
989, said
989, the
989, Caterpillar.
990, 
991, 'Well,
991, perhaps
991, your
991, feelings
991, may
991, be
991, different,'
991, said
991, Alice;
991, 'all
991, I
991, know
992, is,
992, it
992, would
992, feel
992, very
992, queer
992, to
992, ME.'
993, 
994, 'You!'
994, said
994, the
994, Caterpillar
994, contemptuously.
994, 'Who
994, are
994, YOU?'
995, 
996, Which
996, brought
996, them
996, back
996, again
996, to
996, the
996, beginning
996, of
996, the
996, conversation.
997, Alice
997, felt
997, a
997, little
997, irritated
997, at
997, the
997, Caterpillar's
997, making
997, such
997, VERY
998, short
998, remarks,
998, and
998, she
998, drew
998, herself
998, up
998, and
998, said,
998, very
998, gravely,
998, 'I
998, think,
999, you
999, ought
999, to
999, tell
999, me
999, who
999, YOU
999, are,
999, first.'
1000, 
1001, 'Why?'
1001, said
1001, the
1001, Caterpillar.
1002, 
1003, Here
1003, was
1003, another
1003, puzzling
1003, question;
1003, and
1003, as
1003, Alice
1003, could
1003, not
1003, think
1003, of
1003, any
1004, good
1004, reason,
1004, and
1004, as
1004, the
1004, Caterpillar
1004, seemed
1004, to
1004, be
1004, in
1004, a
1004, VERY
1004, unpleasant
1005, state
1005, of
1005, mind,
1005, she
1005, turned
1005, away.
1006, 
1007, 'Come
1007, back!'
1007, the
1007, Caterpillar
1007, called
1007, after
1007, her.
1007, 'I've
1007, something
1007, important
1008, to
1008, say!'
1009, 
1010, This
1010, sounded
1010, promising,
1010, certainly:
1010, Alice
1010, turned
1010, and
1010, came
1010, back
1010, again.
1011, 
1012, 'Keep
1012, your
1012, temper,'
1012, said
1012, the
1012, Caterpillar.
1013, 
1014, 'Is
1014, that
1014, all?'
1014, said
1014, Alice,
1014, swallowing
1014, down
1014, her
1014, anger
1014, as
1014, well
1014, as
1014, she
1015, could.
1016, 
1017, 'No,'
1017, said
1017, the
1017, Caterpillar.
1018, 
1019, Alice
1019, thought
1019, she
1019, might
1019, as
1019, well
1019, wait,
1019, as
1019, she
1019, had
1019, nothing
1019, else
1019, to
1019, do,
1019, and
1020, perhaps
1020, after
1020, all
1020, it
1020, might
1020, tell
1020, her
1020, something
1020, worth
1020, hearing.
1020, For
1020, some
1021, minutes
1021, it
1021, puffed
1021, away
1021, without
1021, speaking,
1021, but
1021, at
1021, last
1021, it
1021, unfolded
1021, its
1022, arms,
1022, took
1022, the
1022, hookah
1022, out
1022, of
1022, its
1022, mouth
1022, again,
1022, and
1022, said,
1022, 'So
1022, you
1022, think
1023, you're
1023, changed,
1023, do
1023, you?'
1024, 
1025, 'I'm
1025, afraid
1025, I
1025, am,
1025, sir,'
1025, said
1025, Alice;
1025, 'I
1025, can't
1025, remember
1025, things
1025, as
1025, I
1026, used--and
1026, I
1026, don't
1026, keep
1026, the
1026, same
1026, size
1026, for
1026, ten
1026, minutes
1026, together!'
1027, 
1028, 'Can't
1028, remember
1028, WHAT
1028, things?'
1028, said
1028, the
1028, Caterpillar.
1029, 
1030, 'Well,
1030, I've
1030, tried
1030, to
1030, say
1030, "HOW
1030, DOTH
1030, THE
1030, LITTLE
1030, BUSY
1030, BEE,"
1030, but
1030, it
1030, all
1030, came
1031, different!'
1031, Alice
1031, replied
1031, in
1031, a
1031, very
1031, melancholy
1031, voice.
1032, 
1033, 'Repeat,
1033, "YOU
1033, ARE
1033, OLD,
1033, FATHER
1033, WILLIAM,"'
1033, said
1033, the
1033, Caterpillar.
1034, 
1035, Alice
1035, folded
1035, her
1035, hands,
1035, and
1035, began:--
1036, 
1037, 'You
1037, are
1037, old,
1037, Father
1037, William,'
1037, the
1037, young
1037, man
1037, said,
1038, 'And
1038, your
1038, hair
1038, has
1038, become
1038, very
1038, white;
1039, And
1039, yet
1039, you
1039, incessantly
1039, stand
1039, on
1039, your
1039, head--
1040, Do
1040, you
1040, think,
1040, at
1040, your
1040, age,
1040, it
1040, is
1040, right?'
1041, 
1042, 'In
1042, my
1042, youth,'
1042, Father
1042, William
1042, replied
1042, to
1042, his
1042, son,
1043, 'I
1043, feared
1043, it
1043, might
1043, injure
1043, the
1043, brain;
1044, But,
1044, now
1044, that
1044, I'm
1044, perfectly
1044, sure
1044, I
1044, have
1044, none,
1045, Why,
1045, I
1045, do
1045, it
1045, again
1045, and
1045, again.'
1046, 
1047, 'You
1047, are
1047, old,'
1047, said
1047, the
1047, youth,
1047, 'as
1047, I
1047, mentioned
1047, before,
1048, And
1048, have
1048, grown
1048, most
1048, uncommonly
1048, fat;
1049, Yet
1049, you
1049, turned
1049, a
1049, back-somersault
1049, in
1049, at
1049, the
1049, door--
1050, Pray,
1050, what
1050, is
1050, the
1050, reason
1050, of
1050, that?'
1051, 
1052, 'In
1052, my
1052, youth,'
1052, said
1052, the
1052, sage,
1052, as
1052, he
1052, shook
1052, his
1052, grey
1052, locks,
1053, 'I
1053, kept
1053, all
1053, my
1053, limbs
1053, very
1053, supple
1054, By
1054, the
1054, use
1054, of
1054, this
1054, ointment--one
1054, shilling
1054, the
1054, box--
1055, Allow
1055, me
1055, to
1055, sell
1055, you
1055, a
1055, couple?'
1056, 
1057, 'You
1057, are
1057, old,'
1057, said
1057, the
1057, youth,
1057, 'and
1057, your
1057, jaws
1057, are
1057, too
1057, weak
1058, For
1058, anything
1058, tougher
1058, than
1058, suet;
1059, Yet
1059, you
1059, finished
1059, the
1059, goose,
1059, with
1059, the
1059, bones
1059, and
1059, the
1059, beak--
1060, Pray
1060, how
1060, did
1060, you
1060, manage
1060, to
1060, do
1060, it?'
1061, 
1062, 'In
1062, my
1062, youth,'
1062, said
1062, his
1062, father,
1062, 'I
1062, took
1062, to
1062, the
1062, law,
1063, And
1063, argued
1063, each
1063, case
1063, with
1063, my
1063, wife;
1064, And
1064, the
1064, muscular
1064, strength,
1064, which
1064, it
1064, gave
1064, to
1064, my
1064, jaw,
1065, Has
1065, lasted
1065, the
1065, rest
1065, of
1065, my
1065, life.'
1066, 
1067, 'You
1067, are
1067, old,'
1067, said
1067, the
1067, youth,
1067, 'one
1067, would
1067, hardly
1067, suppose
1068, That
1068, your
1068, eye
1068, was
1068, as
1068, steady
1068, as
1068, ever;
1069, Yet
1069, you
1069, balanced
1069, an
1069, eel
1069, on
1069, the
1069, end
1069, of
1069, your
1069, nose--
1070, What
1070, made
1070, you
1070, so
1070, awfully
1070, clever?'
1071, 
1072, 'I
1072, have
1072, answered
1072, three
1072, questions,
1072, and
1072, that
1072, is
1072, enough,'
1073, Said
1073, his
1073, father;
1073, 'don't
1073, give
1073, yourself
1073, airs!
1074, Do
1074, you
1074, think
1074, I
1074, can
1074, listen
1074, all
1074, day
1074, to
1074, such
1074, stuff?
1075, Be
1075, off,
1075, or
1075, I'll
1075, kick
1075, you
1075, down
1075, stairs!'
1076, 
1077, 
1078, 'That
1078, is
1078, not
1078, said
1078, right,'
1078, said
1078, the
1078, Caterpillar.
1079, 
1080, 'Not
1080, QUITE
1080, right,
1080, I'm
1080, afraid,'
1080, said
1080, Alice,
1080, timidly;
1080, 'some
1080, of
1080, the
1080, words
1081, have
1081, got
1081, altered.'
1082, 
1083, 'It
1083, is
1083, wrong
1083, from
1083, beginning
1083, to
1083, end,'
1083, said
1083, the
1083, Caterpillar
1083, decidedly,
1083, and
1084, there
1084, was
1084, silence
1084, for
1084, some
1084, minutes.
1085, 
1086, The
1086, Caterpillar
1086, was
1086, the
1086, first
1086, to
1086, speak.
1087, 
1088, 'What
1088, size
1088, do
1088, you
1088, want
1088, to
1088, be?'
1088, it
1088, asked.
1089, 
1090, 'Oh,
1090, I'm
1090, not
1090, particular
1090, as
1090, to
1090, size,'
1090, Alice
1090, hastily
1090, replied;
1090, 'only
1090, one
1091, doesn't
1091, like
1091, changing
1091, so
1091, often,
1091, you
1091, know.'
1092, 
1093, 'I
1093, DON'T
1093, know,'
1093, said
1093, the
1093, Caterpillar.
1094, 
1095, Alice
1095, said
1095, nothing:
1095, she
1095, had
1095, never
1095, been
1095, so
1095, much
1095, contradicted
1095, in
1095, her
1095, life
1096, before,
1096, and
1096, she
1096, felt
1096, that
1096, she
1096, was
1096, losing
1096, her
1096, temper.
1097, 
1098, 'Are
1098, you
1098, content
1098, now?'
1098, said
1098, the
1098, Caterpillar.
1099, 
1100, 'Well,
1100, I
1100, should
1100, like
1100, to
1100, be
1100, a
1100, LITTLE
1100, larger,
1100, sir,
1100, if
1100, you
1100, wouldn't
1100, mind,'
1101, said
1101, Alice:
1101, 'three
1101, inches
1101, is
1101, such
1101, a
1101, wretched
1101, height
1101, to
1101, be.'
1102, 
1103, 'It
1103, is
1103, a
1103, very
1103, good
1103, height
1103, indeed!'
1103, said
1103, the
1103, Caterpillar
1103, angrily,
1103, rearing
1104, itself
1104, upright
1104, as
1104, it
1104, spoke
1104, (it
1104, was
1104, exactly
1104, three
1104, inches
1104, high).
1105, 
1106, 'But
1106, I'm
1106, not
1106, used
1106, to
1106, it!'
1106, pleaded
1106, poor
1106, Alice
1106, in
1106, a
1106, piteous
1106, tone.
1106, And
1107, she
1107, thought
1107, of
1107, herself,
1107, 'I
1107, wish
1107, the
1107, creatures
1107, wouldn't
1107, be
1107, so
1107, easily
1108, offended!'
1109, 
1110, 'You'll
1110, get
1110, used
1110, to
1110, it
1110, in
1110, time,'
1110, said
1110, the
1110, Caterpillar;
1110, and
1110, it
1110, put
1110, the
1111, hookah
1111, into
1111, its
1111, mouth
1111, and
1111, began
1111, smoking
1111, again.
1112, 
1113, This
1113, time
1113, Alice
1113, waited
1113, patiently
1113, until
1113, it
1113, chose
1113, to
1113, speak
1113, again.
1113, In
1114, a
1114, minute
1114, or
1114, two
1114, the
1114, Caterpillar
1114, took
1114, the
1114, hookah
1114, out
1114, of
1114, its
1114, mouth
1115, and
1115, yawned
1115, once
1115, or
1115, twice,
1115, and
1115, shook
1115, itself.
1115, Then
1115, it
1115, got
1115, down
1115, off
1115, the
1116, mushroom,
1116, and
1116, crawled
1116, away
1116, in
1116, the
1116, grass,
1116, merely
1116, remarking
1116, as
1116, it
1116, went,
1117, 'One
1117, side
1117, will
1117, make
1117, you
1117, grow
1117, taller,
1117, and
1117, the
1117, other
1117, side
1117, will
1117, make
1117, you
1118, grow
1118, shorter.'
1119, 
1120, 'One
1120, side
1120, of
1120, WHAT?
1120, The
1120, other
1120, side
1120, of
1120, WHAT?'
1120, thought
1120, Alice
1120, to
1120, herself.
1121, 
1122, 'Of
1122, the
1122, mushroom,'
1122, said
1122, the
1122, Caterpillar,
1122, just
1122, as
1122, if
1122, she
1122, had
1122, asked
1122, it
1123, aloud;
1123, and
1123, in
1123, another
1123, moment
1123, it
1123, was
1123, out
1123, of
1123, sight.
1124, 
1125, Alice
1125, remained
1125, looking
1125, thoughtfully
1125, at
1125, the
1125, mushroom
1125, for
1125, a
1125, minute,
1125, trying
1126, to
1126, make
1126, out
1126, which
1126, were
1126, the
1126, two
1126, sides
1126, of
1126, it;
1126, and
1126, as
1126, it
1126, was
1126, perfectly
1127, round,
1127, she
1127, found
1127, this
1127, a
1127, very
1127, difficult
1127, question.
1127, However,
1127, at
1127, last
1127, she
1128, stretched
1128, her
1128, arms
1128, round
1128, it
1128, as
1128, far
1128, as
1128, they
1128, would
1128, go,
1128, and
1128, broke
1128, off
1128, a
1128, bit
1129, of
1129, the
1129, edge
1129, with
1129, each
1129, hand.
1130, 
1131, 'And
1131, now
1131, which
1131, is
1131, which?'
1131, she
1131, said
1131, to
1131, herself,
1131, and
1131, nibbled
1131, a
1131, little
1131, of
1132, the
1132, right-hand
1132, bit
1132, to
1132, try
1132, the
1132, effect:
1132, the
1132, next
1132, moment
1132, she
1132, felt
1132, a
1132, violent
1133, blow
1133, underneath
1133, her
1133, chin:
1133, it
1133, had
1133, struck
1133, her
1133, foot!
1134, 
1135, She
1135, was
1135, a
1135, good
1135, deal
1135, frightened
1135, by
1135, this
1135, very
1135, sudden
1135, change,
1135, but
1135, she
1135, felt
1136, that
1136, there
1136, was
1136, no
1136, time
1136, to
1136, be
1136, lost,
1136, as
1136, she
1136, was
1136, shrinking
1136, rapidly;
1136, so
1136, she
1137, set
1137, to
1137, work
1137, at
1137, once
1137, to
1137, eat
1137, some
1137, of
1137, the
1137, other
1137, bit.
1137, Her
1137, chin
1137, was
1137, pressed
1138, so
1138, closely
1138, against
1138, her
1138, foot,
1138, that
1138, there
1138, was
1138, hardly
1138, room
1138, to
1138, open
1138, her
1139, mouth;
1139, but
1139, she
1139, did
1139, it
1139, at
1139, last,
1139, and
1139, managed
1139, to
1139, swallow
1139, a
1139, morsel
1139, of
1139, the
1140, lefthand
1140, bit.

1149, my
1149, head's
1149, free
1149, at
1149, last!'
1149, said
1149, Alice
1149, in
1149, a
1149, tone
1149, of
1149, delight,
1149, which
1150, changed
1150, into
1150, alarm
1150, in
1150, another
1150, moment,
1150, when
1150, she
1150, found
1150, that
1150, her
1150, shoulders
1151, were
1151, nowhere
1151, to
1151, be
1151, found:
1151, all
1151, she
1151, could
1151, see,
1151, when
1151, she
1151, looked
1151, down,
1151, was
1152, an
1152, immense
1152, length
1152, of
1152, neck,
1152, which
1152, seemed
1152, to
1152, rise
1152, like
1152, a
1152, stalk
1152, out
1152, of
1152, a
1153, sea
1153, of
1153, green
1153, leaves
1153, that
1153, lay
1153, far
1153, below
1153, her.
1154, 
1155, 'What
1155, CAN
1155, all
1155, that
1155, green
1155, stuff
1155, be?'
1155, said
1155, Alice.
1155, 'And
1155, where
1155, HAVE
1155, my
1156, shoulders
1156, got
1156, to?
1156, And
1156, oh,
1156, my
1156, poor
1156, hands,
1156, how
1156, is
1156, it
1156, I
1156, can't
1156, see
1156, you?'
1157, She
1157, was
1157, moving
1157, them
1157, about
1157, as
1157, she
1157, spoke,
1157, but
1157, no
1157, result
1157, seemed
1157, to
1157, follow,
1158, except
1158, a
1158, little
1158, shaking
1158, among
1158, the
1158, distant
1158, green
1158, leaves.
1159, 
1160, As
1160, there
1160, seemed
1160, to
1160, be
1160, no
1160, chance
1160, of
1160, getting
1160, her
1160, hands
1160, up
1160, to
1160, her
1160, head,
1160, she
1161, tried
1161, to
1161, get
1161, her
1161, head
1161, down
1161, to
1161, them,
1161, and
1161, was
1161, delighted
1161, to
1161, find
1161, that
1161, her
1162, neck
1162, would
1162, bend
1162, about
1162, easily
1162, in
1162, any
1162, direction,
1162, like
1162, a
1162, serpent.
1162, She
1162, had
1163, just
1163, succeeded
1163, in
1163, curving
1163, it
1163, down
1163, into
1163, a
1163, graceful
1163, zigzag,
1163, and
1163, was
1163, going
1164, to
1164, dive
1164, in
1164, among
1164, the
1164, leaves,
1164, which
1164, she
1164, found
1164, to
1164, be
1164, nothing
1164, but
1164, the
1164, tops
1165, of
1165, the
1165, trees
1165, under
1165, which
1165, she
1165, had
1165, been
1165, wandering,
1165, when
1165, a
1165, sharp
1165, hiss
1165, made
1166, her
1166, draw
1166, back
1166, in
1166, a
1166, hurry:
1166, a
1166, large
1166, pigeon
1166, had
1166, flown
1166, into
1166, her
1166, face,
1166, and
1167, was
1167, beating
1167, her
1167, violently
1167, with
1167, its
1167, wings.
1168, 
1169, 'Serpent!'
1169, screamed
1169, the
1169, Pigeon.
1170, 
1171, 'I'm
1171, NOT
1171, a
1171, serpent!'
1171, said
1171, Alice
1171, indignantly.
1171, 'Let
1171, me
1171, alone!'
1172, 
1173, 'Serpent,
1173, I
1173, say
1173, again!'
1173, repeated
1173, the
1173, Pigeon,
1173, but
1173, in
1173, a
1173, more
1173, subdued
1173, tone,
1174, and
1174, added
1174, with
1174, a
1174, kind
1174, of
1174, sob,
1174, 'I've
1174, tried
1174, every
1174, way,
1174, and
1174, nothing
1174, seems
1175, to
1175, suit
1175, them!'
1176, 
1177, 'I
1177, haven't
1177, the
1177, least
1177, idea
1177, what
1177, you're
1177, talking
1177, about,'
1177, said
1177, Alice.
1178, 
1179, 'I've
1179, tried
1179, the
1179, roots
1179, of
1179, trees,
1179, and
1179, I've
1179, tried
1179, banks,
1179, and
1179, I've
1179, tried
1180, hedges,'
1180, the
1180, Pigeon
1180, went
1180, on,
1180, without
1180, attending
1180, to
1180, her;
1180, 'but
1180, those
1181, serpents!
1181, There's
1181, no
1181, pleasing
1181, them!'
1182, 
1183, Alice
1183, was
1183, more
1183, and
1183, more
1183, puzzled,
1183, but
1183, she
1183, thought
1183, there
1183, was
1183, no
1183, use
1183, in
1184, saying
1184, anything
1184, more
1184, till
1184, the
1184, Pigeon
1184, had
1184, finished.
1185, 
1186, 'As
1186, if
1186, it
1186, wasn't
1186, trouble
1186, enough
1186, hatching
1186, the
1186, eggs,'
1186, said
1186, the
1186, Pigeon;
1187, 'but
1187, I
1187, must
1187, be
1187, on
1187, the
1187, look-out
1187, for
1187, serpents
1187, night
1187, and
1187, day!
1187, Why,
1187, I
1188, haven't
1188, had
1188, a
1188, wink
1188, of
1188, sleep
1188, these
1188, three
1188, weeks!'
1189, 
1190, 'I'm
1190, very
1190, sorry
1190, you've
1190, been
1190, annoyed,'
1190, said
1190, Alice,
1190, who
1190, was
1190, beginning
1190, to
1191, see
1191, its
1191, meaning.
1192, 
1193, 'And
1193, just
1193, as
1193, I'd
1193, taken
1193, the
1193, highest
1193, tree
1193, in
1193, the
1193, wood,'
1193, continued
1193, the
1194, Pigeon,
1194, raising
1194, its
1194, voice
1194, to
1194, a
1194, shriek,
1194, 'and
1194, just
1194, as
1194, I
1194, was
1194, thinking
1194, I
1195, should
1195, be
1195, free
1195, of
1195, them
1195, at
1195, last,
1195, they
1195, must
1195, needs
1195, come
1195, wriggling
1195, down
1195, from
1196, the
1196, sky!
1196, Ugh,
1196, Serpent!'
1197, 
1198, 'But
1198, I'm
1198, NOT
1198, a
1198, serpent,
1198, I
1198, tell
1198, you!'
1198, said
1198, Alice.
1198, 'I'm
1198, a--I'm
1198, a--'
1199, 
1200, 'Well!
1200, WHAT
1200, are
1200, you?'
1200, said
1200, the
1200, Pigeon.
1200, 'I
1200, can
1200, see
1200, you're
1200, trying
1200, to
1201, invent
1201, something!'
1202, 
1203, 'I--I'm
1203, a
1203, little
1203, girl,'
1203, said
1203, Alice,
1203, rather
1203, doubtfully,
1203, as
1203, she
1203, remembered
1204, the
1204, number
1204, of
1204, changes
1204, she
1204, had
1204, gone
1204, through
1204, that
1204, day.
1205, 
1206, 'A
1206, likely
1206, story
1206, indeed!'
1206, said
1206, the
1206, Pigeon
1206, in
1206, a
1206, tone
1206, of
1206, the
1206, deepest
1207, contempt.
1207, 'I've
1207, seen
1207, a
1207, good
1207, many
1207, little
1207, girls
1207, in
1207, my
1207, time,
1207, but
1207, never
1207, ONE
1208, with
1208, such
1208, a
1208, neck
1208, as
1208, that!
1208, No,
1208, no!
1208, You're
1208, a
1208, serpent;
1208, and
1208, there's
1208, no
1208, use
1209, denying
1209, it.
1209, I
1209, suppose
1209, you'll
1209, be
1209, telling
1209, me
1209, next
1209, that
1209, you
1209, never
1209, tasted
1209, an
1210, egg!'
1211, 
1212, 'I
1212, HAVE
1212, tasted
1212, eggs,
1212, certainly,'
1212, said
1212, Alice,
1212, who
1212, was
1212, a
1212, very
1212, truthful
1213, child;
1213, 'but
1213, little
1213, girls
1213, eat
1213, eggs
1213, quite
1213, as
1213, much
1213, as
1213, serpents
1213, do,
1213, you
1214, know.'
1215, 
1216, 'I
1216, don't
1216, believe
1216, it,'
1216, said
1216, the
1216, Pigeon;
1216, 'but
1216, if
1216, they
1216, do,
1216, why
1216, then
1216, they're
1217, a
1217, kind
1217, of
1217, serpent,
1217, that's
1217, all
1217, I
1217, can
1217, say.'
1218, 
1219, This
1219, was
1219, such
1219, a
1219, new
1219, idea
1219, to
1219, Alice,
1219, that
1219, she
1219, was
1219, quite
1219, silent
1219, for
1219, a
1220, minute
1220, or
1220, two,
1220, which
1220, gave
1220, the
1220, Pigeon
1220, the
1220, opportunity
1220, of
1220, adding,
1220, 'You're
1221, looking
1221, for
1221, eggs,
1221, I
1221, know
1221, THAT
1221, well
1221, enough;
1221, and
1221, what
1221, does
1221, it
1221, matter
1221, to
1221, me
1222, whether
1222, you're
1222, a
1222, little
1222, girl
1222, or
1222, a
1222, serpent?'
1223, 
1224, 'It
1224, matters
1224, a
1224, good
1224, deal
1224, to
1224, ME,'
1224, said
1224, Alice
1224, hastily;
1224, 'but
1224, I'm
1224, not
1224, looking
1225, for
1225, eggs,
1225, as
1225, it
1225, happens;
1225, and
1225, if
1225, I
1225, was,
1225, I
1225, shouldn't
1225, want
1225, YOURS:
1225, I
1225, don't
1226, like
1226, them
1226, raw.'
1227, 
1228, 'Well,
1228, be
1228, off,
1228, then!'
1228, said
1228, the
1228, Pigeon
1228, in
1228, a
1228, sulky
1228, tone,
1228, as
1228, it
1228, settled
1229, down
1229, again
1229, into
1229, its
1229, nest.
1229, Alice
1229, crouched
1229, down
1229, among
1229, the
1229, trees
1229, as
1229, well
1229, as
1230, she
1230, could,
1230, for
1230, her
1230, neck
1230, kept
1230, getting
1230, entangled
1230, among
1230, the
1230, branches,
1230, and
1231, every
1231, now
1231, and
1231, then
1231, she
1231, had
1231, to
1231, stop
1231, and
1231, untwist
1231, it.
1231, After
1231, a
1231, while
1231, she
1232, remembered
1232, that
1232, she
1232, still
1232, held
1232, the
1232, pieces
1232, of
1232, mushroom
1232, in
1232, her
1232, hands,
1232, and
1233, she
1233, set
1233, to
1233, work
1233, very
1233, carefully,
1233, nibbling
1233, first
1233, at
1233, one
1233, and
1233, then
1233, at
1233, the
1234, other,
1234, and
1234, growing
1234, sometimes
1234, taller
1234, and
1234, sometimes
1234, shorter,
1234, until
1234, she
1234, had
1235, succeeded
1235, in
1235, bringing
1235, herself
1235, down
1235, to
1235, her
1235, usual
1235, height.
1236, 
1237, It
1237, was
1237, so
1237, long
1237, since
1237, she
1237, had
1237, been
1237, anything
1237, near
1237, the
1237, right
1237, size,
1237, that
1237, it
1238, felt
1238, quite
1238, strange
1238, at
1238, first;
1238, but
1238, she
1238, got
1238, used
1238, to
1238, it
1238, in
1238, a
1238, few
1238, minutes,
1239, and
1239, began
1239, talking
1239, to
1239, herself,
1239, as
1239, usual.
1239, 'Come,
1239, there's
1239, half
1239, my
1239, plan
1239, done
1240, now!
1240, How
1240, puzzling
1240, all
1240, these
1240, changes
1240, are!
1240, I'm
1240, never
1240, sure
1240, what
1240, I'm
1240, going
1241, to
1241, be,
1241, from
1241, one
1241, minute
1241, to
1241, another!
1241, However,
1241, I've
1241, got
1241, back
1241, to
1241, my
1241, right
1242, size:
1242, the
1242, next
1242, thing
1242, is,
1242, to
1242, get
1242, into
1242, that
1242, beautiful
1242, garden--how
1242, IS
1242, that
1243, to
1243, be
1243, done,
1243, I
1243, wonder?'
1243, As
1243, she
1243, said
1243, this,
1243, she
1243, came
1243, suddenly
1243, upon
1243, an
1243, open
1244, place,
1244, with
1244, a
1244, little
1244, house
1244, in
1244, it
1244, about
1244, four
1244, feet
1244, high.
1244, 'Whoever
1244, lives
1245, there,'
1245, thought
1245, Alice,
1245, 'it'll
1245, never
1245, do
1245, to
1245, come
1245, upon
1245, them
1245, THIS
1245, size:
1245, why,
1246, I
1246, should
1246, frighten
1246, them
1246, out
1246, of
1246, their
1246, wits!'
1246, So
1246, she
1246, began
1246, nibbling
1246, at
1246, the
1247, righthand
1247, bit
1247, again,
1247, and
1247, did
1247, not
1247, venture
1247, to
1247, go
1247, near
1247, the
1247, house
1247, till
1247, she
1248, had
1248, brought
1248, herself
1248, down
1248, to
1248, nine
1248, inches
1248, high.

1253, CHAPTER
1253, VI.
1253, Pig
1253, and
1253, Pepper
1254, 
1255, For
1255, a
1255, minute
1255, or
1255, two
1255, she
1255, stood
1255, looking
1255, at
1255, the
1255, house,
1255, and
1255, wondering
1255, what
1256, to
1256, do
1256, next,
1256, when
1256, suddenly
1256, a
1256, footman
1256, in
1256, livery
1256, came
1256, running
1256, out
1256, of
1256, the
1257, wood--(she
1257, considered
1257, him
1257, to
1257, be
1257, a
1257, footman
1257, because
1257, he
1257, was
1257, in
1257, livery:
1258, otherwise,
1258, judging
1258, by
1258, his
1258, face
1258, only,
1258, she
1258, would
1258, have
1258, called
1258, him
1258, a
1259, fish)--and
1259, rapped
1259, loudly
1259, at
1259, the
1259, door
1259, with
1259, his
1259, knuckles.
1259, It
1259, was
1259, opened
1260, by
1260, another
1260, footman
1260, in
1260, livery,
1260, with
1260, a
1260, round
1260, face,
1260, and
1260, large
1260, eyes
1260, like
1260, a
1261, frog;
1261, and
1261, both
1261, footmen,
1261, Alice
1261, noticed,
1261, had
1261, powdered
1261, hair
1261, that
1261, curled
1261, all
1262, over
1262, their
1262, heads.
1262, She
1262, felt
1262, very
1262, curious
1262, to
1262, know
1262, what
1262, it
1262, was
1262, all
1262, about,
1263, and
1263, crept
1263, a
1263, little
1263, way
1263, out
1263, of
1263, the
1263, wood
1263, to
1263, listen.
1264, 
1265, The
1265, Fish-Footman
1265, began
1265, by
1265, producing
1265, from
1265, under
1265, his
1265, arm
1265, a
1265, great
1265, letter,
1266, nearly
1266, as
1266, large
1266, as
1266, himself,
1266, and
1266, this
1266, he
1266, handed
1266, over
1266, to
1266, the
1266, other,
1267, saying,
1267, in
1267, a
1267, solemn
1267, tone,
1267, 'For
1267, the
1267, Duchess.
1267, An
1267, invitation
1267, from
1267, the
1267, Queen
1268, to
1268, play
1268, croquet.'
1268, The
1268, Frog-Footman
1268, repeated,
1268, in
1268, the
1268, same
1268, solemn
1268, tone,
1269, only
1269, changing
1269, the
1269, order
1269, of
1269, the
1269, words
1269, a
1269, little,
1269, 'From
1269, the
1269, Queen.
1269, An
1270, invitation
1270, for
1270, the
1270, Duchess
1270, to
1270, play
1270, croquet.'
1271, 
1272, Then
1272, they
1272, both
1272, bowed
1272, low,
1272, and
1272, their
1272, curls
1272, got
1272, entangled
1272, together.
1273, 
1274, Alice
1274, laughed
1274, so
1274, much
1274, at
1274, this,
1274, that
1274, she
1274, had
1274, to
1274, run
1274, back
1274, into
1274, the
1275, wood
1275, for
1275, fear
1275, of
1275, their
1275, hearing
1275, her;
1275, and
1275, when
1275, she
1275, next
1275, peeped
1275, out
1275, the
1276, Fish-Footman
1276, was
1276, gone,
1276, and
1276, the
1276, other
1276, was
1276, sitting
1276, on
1276, the
1276, ground
1276, near
1276, the
1277, door,
1277, staring
1277, stupidly
1277, up
1277, into
1277, the
1277, sky.
1278, 
1279, Alice
1279, went
1279, timidly
1279, up
1279, to
1279, the
1279, door,
1279, and
1279, knocked.
1280, 
1281, 'There's
1281, no
1281, sort
1281, of
1281, use
1281, in
1281, knocking,'
1281, said
1281, the
1281, Footman,
1281, 'and
1281, that
1281, for
1282, two
1282, reasons.
1282, First,
1282, because
1282, I'm
1282, on
1282, the
1282, same
1282, side
1282, of
1282, the
1282, door
1282, as
1282, you
1283, are;
1283, secondly,
1283, because
1283, they're
1283, making
1283, such
1283, a
1283, noise
1283, inside,
1283, no
1283, one
1283, could
1284, possibly
1284, hear
1284, you.'
1284, And
1284, certainly
1284, there
1284, was
1284, a
1284, most
1284, extraordinary
1284, noise
1285, going
1285, on
1285, within--a
1285, constant
1285, howling
1285, and
1285, sneezing,
1285, and
1285, every
1285, now
1285, and
1285, then
1286, a
1286, great
1286, crash,
1286, as
1286, if
1286, a
1286, dish
1286, or
1286, kettle
1286, had
1286, been
1286, broken
1286, to
1286, pieces.
1287, 
1288, 'Please,
1288, then,'
1288, said
1288, Alice,
1288, 'how
1288, am
1288, I
1288, to
1288, get
1288, in?'
1289, 
1290, 'There
1290, might
1290, be
1290, some
1290, sense
1290, in
1290, your
1290, knocking,'
1290, the
1290, Footman
1290, went
1290, on
1291, without
1291, attending
1291, to
1291, her,
1291, 'if
1291, we
1291, had
1291, the
1291, door
1291, between
1291, us.
1291, For
1291, instance,
1292, if
1292, you
1292, were
1292, INSIDE,
1292, you
1292, might
1292, knock,
1292, and
1292, I
1292, could
1292, let
1292, you
1292, out,
1292, you
1292, know.'
1293, He
1293, was
1293, looking
1293, up
1293, into
1293, the
1293, sky
1293, all
1293, the
1293, time
1293, he
1293, was
1293, speaking,
1293, and
1293, this
1294, Alice
1294, thought
1294, decidedly
1294, uncivil.
1294, 'But
1294, perhaps
1294, he
1294, can't
1294, help
1294, it,'
1294, she
1295, said
1295, to
1295, herself;
1295, 'his
1295, eyes
1295, are
1295, so
1295, VERY
1295, nearly
1295, at
1295, the
1295, top
1295, of
1295, his
1295, head.
1296, But
1296, at
1296, any
1296, rate
1296, he
1296, might
1296, answer
1296, questions.--How
1296, am
1296, I
1296, to
1296, get
1296, in?'
1296, she
1297, repeated,
1297, aloud.
1298, 
1299, 'I
1299, shall
1299, sit
1299, here,'
1299, the
1299, Footman
1299, remarked,
1299, 'till
1299, tomorrow--'
1300, 
1301, At
1301, this
1301, moment
1301, the
1301, door
1301, of
1301, the
1301, house
1301, opened,
1301, and
1301, a
1301, large
1301, plate
1301, came
1302, skimming
1302, out,
1302, straight
1302, at
1302, the
1302, Footman's
1302, head:
1302, it
1302, just
1302, grazed
1302, his
1302, nose,
1303, and
1303, broke
1303, to
1303, pieces
1303, against
1303, one
1303, of
1303, the
1303, trees
1303, behind
1303, him.
1304, 
1305, '--or
1305, next
1305, day,
1305, maybe,'
1305, the
1305, Footman
1305, continued
1305, in
1305, the
1305, same
1305, tone,
1305, exactly
1306, as
1306, if
1306, nothing
1306, had
1306, happened.
1307, 
1308, 'How
1308, am
1308, I
1308, to
1308, get
1308, in?'
1308, asked
1308, Alice
1308, again,
1308, in
1308, a
1308, louder
1308, tone.
1309, 
1310, 'ARE
1310, you
1310, to
1310, get
1310, in
1310, at
1310, all?'
1310, said
1310, the
1310, Footman.
1310, 'That's
1310, the
1310, first
1311, question,
1311, you
1311, know.'
1312, 
1313, It
1313, was,
1313, no
1313, doubt:
1313, only
1313, Alice
1313, did
1313, not
1313, like
1313, to
1313, be
1313, told
1313, so.
1313, 'It's
1313, really
1314, dreadful,'
1314, she
1314, muttered
1314, to
1314, herself,
1314, 'the
1314, way
1314, all
1314, the
1314, creatures
1314, argue.
1315, It's
1315, enough
1315, to
1315, drive
1315, one
1315, crazy!'
1316, 
1317, The
1317, Footman
1317, seemed
1317, to
1317, think
1317, this
1317, a
1317, good
1317, opportunity
1317, for
1317, repeating
1317, his
1318, remark,
1318, with
1318, variations.
1318, 'I
1318, shall
1318, sit
1318, here,'
1318, he
1318, said,
1318, 'on
1318, and
1318, off,
1318, for
1319, days
1319, and
1319, days.'
1320, 
1321, 'But
1321, what
1321, am
1321, I
1321, to
1321, do?'
1321, said
1321, Alice.
1322, 
1323, 'Anything
1323, you
1323, like,'
1323, said
1323, the
1323, Footman,
1323, and
1323, began
1323, whistling.
1324, 
1325, 'Oh,
1325, there's
1325, no
1325, use
1325, in
1325, talking
1325, to
1325, him,'
1325, said
1325, Alice
1325, desperately:
1325, 'he's
1326, perfectly
1326, idiotic!'
1326, And
1326, she
1326, opened
1326, the
1326, door
1326, and
1326, went
1326, in.
1327, 
1328, The
1328, door
1328, led
1328, right
1328, into
1328, a
1328, large
1328, kitchen,
1328, which
1328, was
1328, full
1328, of
1328, smoke
1328, from
1329, one
1329, end
1329, to
1329, the
1329, other:
1329, the
1329, Duchess
1329, was
1329, sitting
1329, on
1329, a
1329, three-legged
1329, stool
1329, in
1330, the
1330, middle,
1330, nursing
1330, a
1330, baby;
1330, the
1330, cook
1330, was
1330, leaning
1330, over
1330, the
1330, fire,
1330, stirring
1331, a
1331, large
1331, cauldron
1331, which
1331, seemed
1331, to
1331, be
1331, full
1331, of
1331, soup.
1332, 
1333, 'There's
1333, certainly
1333, too
1333, much
1333, pepper
1333, in
1333, that
1333, soup!'
1333, Alice
1333, said
1333, to
1333, herself,
1334, as
1334, well
1334, as
1334, she
1334, could
1334, for
1334, sneezing.
1335, 
1336, There
1336, was
1336, certainly
1336, too
1336, much
1336, of
1336, it
1336, in
1336, the
1336, air.
1336, Even
1336, the
1336, Duchess
1337, sneezed
1337, occasionally;
1337, and
1337, as
1337, for
1337, the
1337, baby,
1337, it
1337, was
1337, sneezing
1337, and
1337, howling
1338, alternately
1338, without
1338, a
1338, moment's
1338, pause.
1338, The
1338, only
1338, things
1338, in
1338, the
1338, kitchen
1339, that
1339, did
1339, not
1339, sneeze,
1339, were
1339, the
1339, cook,
1339, and
1339, a
1339, large
1339, cat
1339, which
1339, was
1339, sitting
1339, on
1340, the
1340, hearth
1340, and
1340, grinning
1340, from
1340, ear
1340, to
1340, ear.
1341, 
1342, 'Please
1342, would
1342, you
1342, tell
1342, me,'
1342, said
1342, Alice,
1342, a
1342, little
1342, timidly,
1342, for
1342, she
1342, was
1343, not
1343, quite
1343, sure
1343, whether
1343, it
1343, was
1343, good
1343, manners
1343, for
1343, her
1343, to
1343, speak
1343, first,
1343, 'why
1344, your
1344, cat
1344, grins
1344, like
1344, that?'
1345, 
1346, 'It's
1346, a
1346, Cheshire
1346, cat,'
1346, said
1346, the
1346, Duchess,
1346, 'and
1346, that's
1346, why.
1346, Pig!'
1347, 
1348, She
1348, said
1348, the
1348, last
1348, word
1348, with
1348, such
1348, sudden
1348, violence
1348, that
1348, Alice
1348, quite
1349, jumped;
1349, but
1349, she
1349, saw
1349, in
1349, another
1349, moment
1349, that
1349, it
1349, was
1349, addressed
1349, to
1349, the
1349, baby,
1350, and
1350, not
1350, to
1350, her,
1350, so
1350, she
1350, took
1350, courage,
1350, and
1350, went
1350, on
1350, again:--
1351, 
1352, 'I
1352, didn't
1352, know
1352, that
1352, Cheshire
1352, cats
1352, always
1352, grinned;
1352, in
1352, fact,
1352, I
1352, didn't
1352, know
1353, that
1353, cats
1353, COULD
1353, grin.'
1354, 
1355, 'They
1355, all
1355, can,'
1355, said
1355, the
1355, Duchess;
1355, 'and
1355, most
1355, of
1355, 'em
1355, do.'
1356, 
1357, 'I
1357, don't
1357, know
1357, of
1357, any
1357, that
1357, do,'
1357, Alice
1357, said
1357, very
1357, politely,
1357, feeling
1357, quite
1358, pleased
1358, to
1358, have
1358, got
1358, into
1358, a
1358, conversation.
1359, 
1360, 'You
1360, don't
1360, know
1360, much,'
1360, said
1360, the
1360, Duchess;
1360, 'and
1360, that's
1360, a
1360, fact.'
1361, 
1362, Alice
1362, did
1362, not
1362, at
1362, all
1362, like
1362, the
1362, tone
1362, of
1362, this
1362, remark,
1362, and
1362, thought
1362, it
1362, would
1363, be
1363, as
1363, well
1363, to
1363, introduce
1363, some
1363, other
1363, subject
1363, of
1363, conversation.
1363, While
1363, she
1364, was
1364, trying
1364, to
1364, fix
1364, on
1364, one,
1364, the
1364, cook
1364, took
1364, the
1364, cauldron
1364, of
1364, soup
1364, off
1364, the
1365, fire,
1365, and
1365, at
1365, once
1365, set
1365, to
1365, work
1365, throwing
1365, everything
1365, within
1365, her
1365, reach
1365, at
1366, the
1366, Duchess
1366, and
1366, the
1366, baby--the
1366, fire-irons
1366, came
1366, first;
1366, then
1366, followed
1366, a
1367, shower
1367, of
1367, saucepans,
1367, plates,
1367, and
1367, dishes.
1367, The
1367, Duchess
1367, took
1367, no
1367, notice
1367, of
1368, them
1368, even
1368, when
1368, they
1368, hit
1368, her;
1368, and
1368, the
1368, baby
1368, was
1368, howling
1368, so
1368, much
1368, already,
1369, that
1369, it
1369, was
1369, quite
1369, impossible
1369, to
1369, say
1369, whether
1369, the
1369, blows
1369, hurt
1369, it
1369, or
1369, not.
1370, 
1371, 'Oh,
1371, PLEASE
1371, mind
1371, what
1371, you're
1371, doing!'
1371, cried
1371, Alice,
1371, jumping
1371, up
1371, and
1371, down
1371, in
1372, an
1372, agony
1372, of
1372, terror.
1372, 'Oh,
1372, there
1372, goes
1372, his
1372, PRECIOUS
1372, nose';
1372, as
1372, an
1372, unusually
1373, large
1373, saucepan
1373, flew
1373, close
1373, by
1373, it,
1373, and
1373, very
1373, nearly
1373, carried
1373, it
1373, off.
1374, 
1375, 'If
1375, everybody
1375, minded
1375, their
1375, own
1375, business,'
1375, the
1375, Duchess
1375, said
1375, in
1375, a
1375, hoarse
1376, growl,
1376, 'the
1376, world
1376, would
1376, go
1376, round
1376, a
1376, deal
1376, faster
1376, than
1376, it
1376, does.'
1377, 
1378, 'Which
1378, would
1378, NOT
1378, be
1378, an
1378, advantage,'
1378, said
1378, Alice,
1378, who
1378, felt
1378, very
1378, glad
1378, to
1378, get
1379, an
1379, opportunity
1379, of
1379, showing
1379, off
1379, a
1379, little
1379, of
1379, her
1379, knowledge.
1379, 'Just
1379, think
1379, of
1380, what
1380, work
1380, it
1380, would
1380, make
1380, with
1380, the
1380, day
1380, and
1380, night!
1380, You
1380, see
1380, the
1380, earth
1380, takes
1381, twenty-four
1381, hours
1381, to
1381, turn
1381, round
1381, on
1381, its
1381, axis--'
1382, 
1383, 'Talking
1383, of
1383, axes,'
1383, said
1383, the
1383, Duchess,
1383, 'chop
1383, off
1383, her
1383, head!'
1384, 
1385, Alice
1385, glanced
1385, rather
1385, anxiously
1385, at
1385, the
1385, cook,
1385, to
1385, see
1385, if
1385, she
1385, meant
1385, to
1385, take
1386, the
1386, hint;
1386, but
1386, the
1386, cook
1386, was
1386, busily
1386, stirring
1386, the
1386, soup,
1386, and
1386, seemed
1386, not
1386, to
1387, be
1387, listening,
1387, so
1387, she
1387, went
1387, on
1387, again:
1387, 'Twenty-four
1387, hours,
1387, I
1387, THINK;
1387, or
1387, is
1388, it
1388, twelve?
1388, I--'
1389, 
1390, 'Oh,
1390, don't
1390, bother
1390, ME,'
1390, said
1390, the
1390, Duchess;
1390, 'I
1390, never
1390, could
1390, abide
1390, figures!'
1391, And
1391, with
1391, that
1391, she
1391, began
1391, nursing
1391, her
1391, child
1391, again,
1391, singing
1391, a
1391, sort
1391, of
1392, lullaby
1392, to
1392, it
1392, as
1392, she
1392, did
1392, so,
1392, and
1392, giving
1392, it
1392, a
1392, violent
1392, shake
1392, at
1392, the
1392, end
1392, of
1393, every
1393, line:
1394, 
1395, 'Speak
1395, roughly
1395, to
1395, your
1395, little
1395, boy,
1396, And
1396, beat
1396, him
1396, when
1396, he
1396, sneezes:
1397, He
1397, only
1397, does
1397, it
1397, to
1397, annoy,
1398, Because
1398, he
1398, knows
1398, it
1398, teases.'
1399, 
1400, CHORUS.
1401, 
1402, (In
1402, which
1402, the
1402, cook
1402, and
1402, the
1402, baby
1402, joined):--
1403, 
1404, 'Wow!
1404, wow!
1404, wow!'
1405, 
1406, While
1406, the
1406, Duchess
1406, sang
1406, the
1406, second
1406, verse
1406, of
1406, the
1406, song,
1406, she
1406, kept
1406, tossing
1407, the
1407, baby
1407, violently
1407, up
1407, and
1407, down,
1407, and
1407, the
1407, poor
1407, little
1407, thing
1407, howled
1407, so,
1408, that
1408, Alice
1408, could
1408, hardly
1408, hear
1408, the
1408, words:--
1409, 
1410, 'I
1410, speak
1410, severely
1410, to
1410, my
1410, boy,
1411, I
1411, beat
1411, him
1411, when
1411, he
1411, sneezes;
1412, For
1412, he
1412, can
1412, thoroughly
1412, enjoy
1413, The
1413, pepper
1413, when
1413, he
1413, pleases!'
1414, 
1415, CHORUS.
1416, 
1417, 'Wow!
1417, wow!
1417, wow!'
1418, 
1419, 'Here!
1419, you
1419, may
1419, nurse
1419, it
1419, a
1419, bit,
1419, if
1419, you
1419, like!'
1419, the
1419, Duchess
1419, said
1419, to
1419, Alice,
1420, flinging
1420, the
1420, baby
1420, at
1420, her
1420, as
1420, she
1420, spoke.
1420, 'I
1420, must
1420, go
1420, and
1420, get
1420, ready
1420, to
1420, play
1421, croquet
1421, with
1421, the
1421, Queen,'
1421, and
1421, she
1421, hurried
1421, out
1421, of
1421, the
1421, room.
1421, The
1421, cook
1421, threw
1422, a
1422, frying-pan
1422, after
1422, her
1422, as
1422, she
1422, went
1422, out,
1422, but
1422, it
1422, just
1422, missed
1422, her.
1423, 
1424, Alice
1424, caught
1424, the
1424, baby
1424, with
1424, some
1424, difficulty,
1424, as
1424, it
1424, was
1424, a
1424, queer-shaped
1425, little
1425, creature,
1425, and
1425, held
1425, out
1425, its
1425, arms
1425, and
1425, legs
1425, in
1425, all
1425, directions,
1425, 'just
1426, like
1426, a
1426, star-fish,'
1426, thought
1426, Alice.
1426, The
1426, poor
1426, little
1426, thing
1426, was
1426, snorting
1427, like
1427, a
1427, steam-engine
1427, when
1427, she
1427, caught
1427, it,
1427, and
1427, kept
1427, doubling
1427, itself
1427, up
1427, and
1428, straightening
1428, itself
1428, out
1428, again,
1428, so
1428, that
1428, altogether,
1428, for
1428, the
1428, first
1428, minute
1429, or
1429, two,
1429, it
1429, was
1429, as
1429, much
1429, as
1429, she
1429, could
1429, do
1429, to
1429, hold
1429, it.
1430, 
1431, As
1431, soon
1431, as
1431, she
1431, had
1431, made
1431, out
1431, the
1431, proper
1431, way
1431, of
1431, nursing
1431, it,
1431, (which
1431, was
1431, to
1432, twist
1432, it
1432, up
1432, into
1432, a
1432, sort
1432, of
1432, knot,
1432, and
1432, then
1432, keep
1432, tight
1432, hold
1432, of
1432, its
1432, right
1433, ear
1433, and
1433, left
1433, foot,
1433, so
1433, as
1433, to
1433, prevent
1433, its
1433, undoing
1433, itself,)
1433, she
1433, carried
1434, it
1434, out
1434, into
1434, the
1434, open
1434, air.
1434, 'IF
1434, I
1434, don't
1434, take
1434, this
1434, child
1434, away
1434, with
1434, me,'
1435, thought
1435, Alice,
1435, 'they're
1435, sure
1435, to
1435, kill
1435, it
1435, in
1435, a
1435, day
1435, or
1435, two:
1435, wouldn't
1435, it
1435, be
1436, murder
1436, to
1436, leave
1436, it
1436, behind?'
1436, She
1436, said
1436, the
1436, last
1436, words
1436, out
1436, loud,
1436, and
1436, the
1437, little
1437, thing
1437, grunted
1437, in
1437, reply
1437, (it
1437, had
1437, left
1437, off
1437, sneezing
1437, by
1437, this
1437, time).
1438, 'Don't
1438, grunt,'
1438, said
1438, Alice;
1438, 'that's
1438, not
1438, at
1438, all
1438, a
1438, proper
1438, way
1438, of
1438, expressing
1439, yourself.'
1440, 
1441, The
1441, baby
1441, grunted
1441, again,
1441, and
1441, Alice
1441, looked
1441, very
1441, anxiously
1441, into
1441, its
1441, face
1441, to
1442, see
1442, what
1442, was
1442, the
1442, matter
1442, with
1442, it.
1442, There
1442, could
1442, be
1442, no
1442, doubt
1442, that
1442, it
1442, had
1443, a
1443, VERY
1443, turn-up
1443, nose,
1443, much
1443, more
1443, like
1443, a
1443, snout
1443, than
1443, a
1443, real
1443, nose;
1443, also
1443, its
1444, eyes
1444, were
1444, getting
1444, extremely
1444, small
1444, for
1444, a
1444, baby:
1444, altogether
1444, Alice
1444, did
1444, not
1445, like
1445, the
1445, look
1445, of
1445, the
1445, thing
1445, at
1445, all.
1445, 'But
1445, perhaps
1445, it
1445, was
1445, only
1445, sobbing,'
1446, she
1446, thought,
1446, and
1446, looked
1446, into
1446, its
1446, eyes
1446, again,
1446, to
1446, see
1446, if
1446, there
1446, were
1446, any
1447, tears.
1448, 
1449, No,
1449, there
1449, were
1449, no
1449, tears.
1449, 'If
1449, you're
1449, going
1449, to
1449, turn
1449, into
1449, a
1449, pig,
1449, my
1449, dear,'
1450, said
1450, Alice,
1450, seriously,
1450, 'I'll
1450, have
1450, nothing
1450, more
1450, to
1450, do
1450, with
1450, you.
1450, Mind
1451, now!'
1451, The
1451, poor
1451, little
1451, thing
1451, sobbed
1451, again
1451, (or
1451, grunted,
1451, it
1451, was
1451, impossible
1452, to
1452, say
1452, which),
1452, and
1452, they
1452, went
1452, on
1452, for
1452, some
1452, while
1452, in
1452, silence.
1453, 
1454, Alice
1454, was
1454, just
1454, beginning
1454, to
1454, think
1454, to
1454, herself,
1454, 'Now,
1454, what
1454, am
1454, I
1454, to
1454, do
1454, with
1455, this
1455, creature
1455, when
1455, I
1455, get
1455, it
1455, home?'
1455, when
1455, it
1455, grunted
1455, again,
1455, so
1455, violently,
1456, that
1456, she
1456, looked
1456, down
1456, into
1456, its
1456, face
1456, in
1456, some
1456, alarm.
1456, This
1456, time
1456, there
1456, could
1457, be
1457, NO
1457, mistake
1457, about
1457, it:
1457, it
1457, was
1457, neither
1457, more
1457, nor
1457, less
1457, than
1457, a
1457, pig,
1457, and
1457, she
1458, felt
1458, that
1458, it
1458, would
1458, be
1458, quite
1458, absurd
1458, for
1458, her
1458, to
1458, carry
1458, it
1458, further.
1459, 
1460, So
1460, she
1460, set
1460, the
1460, little
1460, creature
1460, down,
1460, and
1460, felt
1460, quite
1460, relieved
1460, to
1460, see
1461, it
1461, trot
1461, away
1461, quietly
1461, into
1461, the
1461, wood.
1461, 'If
1461, it
1461, had
1461, grown
1461, up,'
1461, she
1461, said
1462, to
1462, herself,
1462, 'it
1462, would
1462, have
1462, made
1462, a
1462, dreadfully
1462, ugly
1462, child:
1462, but
1462, it
1462, makes
1463, rather
1463, a
1463, handsome
1463, pig,
1463, I
1463, think.'
1463, And
1463, she
1463, began
1463, thinking
1463, over
1463, other
1464, children
1464, she
1464, knew,
1464, who
1464, might
1464, do
1464, very
1464, well
1464, as
1464, pigs,
1464, and
1464, was
1464, just
1464, saying
1465, to
1465, herself,
1465, 'if
1465, one
1465, only
1465, knew
1465, the
1465, right
1465, way
1465, to
1465, change
1465, them--'
1465, when
1465, she
1466, was
1466, a
1466, little
1466, startled
1466, by
1466, seeing
1466, the
1466, Cheshire
1466, Cat
1466, sitting
1466, on
1466, a
1466, bough
1466, of
1466, a
1467, tree
1467, a
1467, few
1467, yards
1467, off.
1468, 
1469, The
1469, Cat
1469, only
1469, grinned
1469, when
1469, it
1469, saw
1469, Alice.
1469, It
1469, looked
1469, good-natured,
1469, she
1470, thought:
1470, still
1470, it
1470, had
1470, VERY
1470, long
1470, claws
1470, and
1470, a
1470, great
1470, many
1470, teeth,
1470, so
1470, she
1471, felt
1471, that
1471, it
1471, ought
1471, to
1471, be
1471, treated
1471, with
1471, respect.
1472, 
1473, 'Cheshire
1473, Puss,'
1473, she
1473, began,
1473, rather
1473, timidly,
1473, as
1473, she
1473, did
1473, not
1473, at
1473, all
1473, know
1474, whether
1474, it
1474, would
1474, like
1474, the
1474, name:
1474, however,
1474, it
1474, only
1474, grinned
1474, a
1474, little
1474, wider.
1475, 'Come,
1475, it's
1475, pleased
1475, so
1475, far,'
1475, thought
1475, Alice,
1475, and
1475, she
1475, went
1475, on.
1475, 'Would
1475, you
1476, tell
1476, me,
1476, please,
1476, which
1476, way
1476, I
1476, ought
1476, to
1476, go
1476, from
1476, here?'
1477, 
1478, 'That
1478, depends
1478, a
1478, good
1478, deal
1478, on
1478, where
1478, you
1478, want
1478, to
1478, get
1478, to,'
1478, said
1478, the
1478, Cat.
1479, 
1480, 'I
1480, don't
1480, much
1480, care
1480, where--'
1480, said
1480, Alice.
1481, 
1482, 'Then
1482, it
1482, doesn't
1482, matter
1482, which
1482, way
1482, you
1482, go,'
1482, said
1482, the
1482, Cat.
1483, 
1484, '--so
1484, long
1484, as
1484, I
1484, get
1484, SOMEWHERE,'
1484, Alice
1484, added
1484, as
1484, an
1484, explanation.
1485, 
1486, 'Oh,
1486, you're
1486, sure
1486, to
1486, do
1486, that,'
1486, said
1486, the
1486, Cat,
1486, 'if
1486, you
1486, only
1486, walk
1486, long
1487, enough.'
1488, 
1489, Alice
1489, felt
1489, that
1489, this
1489, could
1489, not
1489, be
1489, denied,
1489, so
1489, she
1489, tried
1489, another
1489, question.
1490, 'What
1490, sort
1490, of
1490, people
1490, live
1490, about
1490, here?'
1491, 
1492, 'In
1492, THAT
1492, direction,'
1492, the
1492, Cat
1492, said,
1492, waving
1492, its
1492, right
1492, paw
1492, round,
1492, 'lives
1493, a
1493, Hatter:
1493, and
1493, in
1493, THAT
1493, direction,'
1493, waving
1493, the
1493, other
1493, paw,
1493, 'lives
1493, a
1493, March
1494, Hare.
1494, Visit
1494, either
1494, you
1494, like:
1494, they're
1494, both
1494, mad.'
1495, 
1496, 'But
1496, I
1496, don't
1496, want
1496, to
1496, go
1496, among
1496, mad
1496, people,'
1496, Alice
1496, remarked.
1497, 
1498, 'Oh,
1498, you
1498, can't
1498, help
1498, that,'
1498, said
1498, the
1498, Cat:
1498, 'we're
1498, all
1498, mad
1498, here.
1498, I'm
1498, mad.
1499, You're
1499, mad.'
1500, 
1501, 'How
1501, do
1501, you
1501, know
1501, I'm
1501, mad?'
1501, said
1501, Alice.
1502, 
1503, 'You
1503, must
1503, be,'
1503, said
1503, the
1503, Cat,
1503, 'or
1503, you
1503, wouldn't
1503, have
1503, come
1503, here.'
1504, 
1505, Alice
1505, didn't
1505, think
1505, that
1505, proved
1505, it
1505, at
1505, all;
1505, however,
1505, she
1505, went
1505, on
1505, 'And
1505, how
1506, do
1506, you
1506, know
1506, that
1506, you're
1506, mad?'
1507, 
1508, 'To
1508, begin
1508, with,'
1508, said
1508, the
1508, Cat,
1508, 'a
1508, dog's
1508, not
1508, mad.
1508, You
1508, grant
1508, that?'
1509, 
1510, 'I
1510, suppose
1510, so,'
1510, said
1510, Alice.
1511, 
1512, 'Well,
1512, then,'
1512, the
1512, Cat
1512, went
1512, on,
1512, 'you
1512, see,
1512, a
1512, dog
1512, growls
1512, when
1512, it's
1512, angry,
1513, and
1513, wags
1513, its
1513, tail
1513, when
1513, it's
1513, pleased.
1513, Now
1513, I
1513, growl
1513, when
1513, I'm
1513, pleased,
1513, and
1514, wag
1514, my
1514, tail
1514, when
1514, I'm
1514, angry.
1514, Therefore
1514, I'm
1514, mad.'
1515, 
1516, 'I
1516, call
1516, it
1516, purring,
1516, not
1516, growling,'
1516, said
1516, Alice.
1517, 
1518, 'Call
1518, it
1518, what
1518, you
1518, like,'
1518, said
1518, the
1518, Cat.
1518, 'Do
1518, you
1518, play
1518, croquet
1518, with
1518, the
1519, Queen
1519, to-day?'
1520, 
1521, 'I
1521, should
1521, like
1521, it
1521, very
1521, much,'
1521, said
1521, Alice,
1521, 'but
1521, I
1521, haven't
1521, been
1521, invited
1522, yet.'
1523, 
1524, 'You'll
1524, see
1524, me
1524, there,'
1524, said
1524, the
1524, Cat,
1524, and
1524, vanished.
1525, 
1526, Alice
1526, was
1526, not
1526, much
1526, surprised
1526, at
1526, this,
1526, she
1526, was
1526, getting
1526, so
1526, used
1526, to
1526, queer
1527, things
1527, happening.
1527, While
1527, she
1527, was
1527, looking
1527, at
1527, the
1527, place
1527, where
1527, it
1527, had
1527, been,
1528, it
1528, suddenly
1528, appeared
1528, again.
1529, 
1530, 'By-the-bye,
1530, what
1530, became
1530, of
1530, the
1530, baby?'
1530, said
1530, the
1530, Cat.
1530, 'I'd
1530, nearly
1531, forgotten
1531, to
1531, ask.'
1532, 
1533, 'It
1533, turned
1533, into
1533, a
1533, pig,'
1533, Alice
1533, quietly
1533, said,
1533, just
1533, as
1533, if
1533, it
1533, had
1533, come
1533, back
1534, in
1534, a
1534, natural
1534, way.
1535, 
1536, 'I
1536, thought
1536, it
1536, would,'
1536, said
1536, the
1536, Cat,
1536, and
1536, vanished
1536, again.
1537, 
1538, Alice
1538, waited
1538, a
1538, little,
1538, half
1538, expecting
1538, to
1538, see
1538, it
1538, again,
1538, but
1538, it
1538, did
1538, not
1539, appear,
1539, and
1539, after
1539, a
1539, minute
1539, or
1539, two
1539, she
1539, walked
1539, on
1539, in
1539, the
1539, direction
1539, in
1540, which
1540, the
1540, March
1540, Hare
1540, was
1540, said
1540, to
1540, live.
1540, 'I've
1540, seen
1540, hatters
1540, before,'
1540, she
1541, said
1541, to
1541, herself;
1541, 'the
1541, March
1541, Hare
1541, will
1541, be
1541, much
1541, the
1541, most
1541, interesting,
1541, and
1542, perhaps
1542, as
1542, this
1542, is
1542, May
1542, it
1542, won't
1542, be
1542, raving
1542, mad--at
1542, least
1542, not
1542, so
1542, mad
1542, as
1543, it
1543, was
1543, in
1543, March.'
1543, As
1543, she
1543, said
1543, this,
1543, she
1543, looked
1543, up,
1543, and
1543, there
1543, was
1543, the
1543, Cat
1544, again,
1544, sitting
1544, on
1544, a
1544, branch
1544, of
1544, a
1544, tree.
1545, 
1546, 'Did
1546, you
1546, say
1546, pig,
1546, or
1546, fig?'
1546, said
1546, the
1546, Cat.
1547, 
1548, 'I
1548, said
1548, pig,'
1548, replied
1548, Alice;
1548, 'and
1548, I
1548, wish
1548, you
1548, wouldn't
1548, keep
1548, appearing
1548, and
1549, vanishing
1549, so
1549, suddenly:
1549, you
1549, make
1549, one
1549, quite
1549, giddy.'
1550, 
1551, 'All
1551, right,'
1551, said
1551, the
1551, Cat;
1551, and
1551, this
1551, time
1551, it
1551, vanished
1551, quite
1551, slowly,
1552, beginning
1552, with
1552, the
1552, end
1552, of
1552, the
1552, tail,
1552, and
1552, ending
1552, with
1552, the
1552, grin,
1552, which
1553, remained
1553, some
1553, time
1553, after
1553, the
1553, rest
1553, of
1553, it
1553, had
1553, gone.
1554, 
1555, 'Well!
1555, I've
1555, often
1555, seen
1555, a
1555, cat
1555, without
1555, a
1555, grin,'
1555, thought
1555, Alice;
1555, 'but
1555, a
1555, grin
1556, without
1556, a
1556, cat!
1556, It's
1556, the
1556, most
1556, curious
1556, thing
1556, I
1556, ever
1556, saw
1556, in
1556, my
1556, life!'
1557, 
1558, She
1558, had
1558, not
1558, gone
1558, much
1558, farther
1558, before
1558, she
1558, came
1558, in
1558, sight
1558, of
1558, the
1558, house
1559, of
1559, the
1559, March
1559, Hare:
1559, she
1559, thought
1559, it
1559, must
1559, be
1559, the
1559, right
1559, house,
1559, because
1559, the
1560, chimneys
1560, were
1560, shaped
1560, like
1560, ears
1560, and
1560, the
1560, roof
1560, was
1560, thatched
1560, with
1560, fur.
1560, It
1561, was
1561, so
1561, large
1561, a
1561, house,
1561, that
1561, she
1561, did
1561, not
1561, like
1561, to
1561, go
1561, nearer
1561, till
1561, she
1561, had
1562, nibbled
1562, some
1562, more
1562, of
1562, the
1562, lefthand
1562, bit
1562, of
1562, mushroom,
1562, and
1562, raised
1562, herself
1562, to
1563, about
1563, two
1563, feet
1563, high:
1563, even
1563, then
1563, she
1563, walked
1563, up
1563, towards
1563, it
1563, rather
1563, timidly,
1564, saying
1564, to
1564, herself
1564, 'Suppose
1564, it
1564, should
1564, be
1564, raving
1564, mad
1564, after
1564, all!
1564, I
1564, almost
1565, wish
1565, I'd
1565, gone
1565, to
1565, see
1565, the
1565, Hatter
1565, instead!'
1566, 
1567, 
1568, 
1569, 
1570, CHAPTER
1570, VII.
1570, A
1570, Mad
1570, Tea-Party
1571, 
1572, There
1572, was
1572, a
1572, table
1572, set
1572, out
1572, under
1572, a
1572, tree
1572, in
1572, front
1572, of
1572, the
1572, house,
1572, and
1572, the
1573, March
1573, Hare
1573, and
1573, the
1573, Hatter
1573, were
1573, having
1573, tea
1573, at
1573, it:
1573, a
1573, Dormouse
1573, was
1573, sitting
1574, between
1574, them,
1574, fast
1574, asleep,
1574, and
1574, the
1574, other
1574, two
1574, were
1574, using
1574, it
1574, as
1574, a
1575, cushion,
1575, resting
1575, their
1575, elbows
1575, on
1575, it,
1575, and
1575, talking
1575, over
1575, its
1575, head.
1575, 'Very
1576, uncomfortable
1576, for
1576, the
1576, Dormouse,'
1576, thought
1576, Alice;
1576, 'only,
1576, as
1576, it's
1576, asleep,
1576, I
1577, suppose
1577, it
1577, doesn't
1577, mind.'
1578, 
1579, The
1579, table
1579, was
1579, a
1579, large
1579, one,
1579, but
1579, the
1579, three
1579, were
1579, all
1579, crowded
1579, together
1579, at
1580, one
1580, corner
1580, of
1580, it:
1580, 'No
1580, room!
1580, No
1580, room!'
1580, they
1580, cried
1580, out
1580, when
1580, they
1580, saw
1580, Alice
1581, coming.
1581, 'There's
1581, PLENTY
1581, of
1581, room!'
1581, said
1581, Alice
1581, indignantly,
1581, and
1581, she
1581, sat
1582, down
1582, in
1582, a
1582, large
1582, arm-chair
1582, at
1582, one
1582, end
1582, of
1582, the
1582, table.
1583, 
1584, 'Have
1584, some
1584, wine,'
1584, the
1584, March
1584, Hare
1584, said
1584, in
1584, an
1584, encouraging
1584, tone.
1585, 
1586, Alice
1586, looked
1586, all
1586, round
1586, the
1586, table,
1586, but
1586, there
1586, was
1586, nothing
1586, on
1586, it
1586, but
1586, tea.
1587, 'I
1587, don't
1587, see
1587, any
1587, wine,'
1587, she
1587, remarked.
1588, 
1589, 'There
1589, isn't
1589, any,'
1589, said
1589, the
1589, March
1589, Hare.
1590, 
1591, 'Then
1591, it
1591, wasn't
1591, very
1591, civil
1591, of
1591, you
1591, to
1591, offer
1591, it,'
1591, said
1591, Alice
1591, angrily.
1592, 
1593, 'It
1593, wasn't
1593, very
1593, civil
1593, of
1593, you
1593, to
1593, sit
1593, down
1593, without
1593, being
1593, invited,'
1593, said
1594, the
1594, March
1594, Hare.
1595, 
1596, 'I
1596, didn't
1596, know
1596, it
1596, was
1596, YOUR
1596, table,'
1596, said
1596, Alice;
1596, 'it's
1596, laid
1596, for
1596, a
1596, great
1597, many
1597, more
1597, than
1597, three.'
1598, 
1599, 'Your
1599, hair
1599, wants
1599, cutting,'
1599, said
1599, the
1599, Hatter.
1599, He
1599, had
1599, been
1599, looking
1599, at
1599, Alice
1600, for
1600, some
1600, time
1600, with
1600, great
1600, curiosity,
1600, and
1600, this
1600, was
1600, his
1600, first
1600, speech.
1601, 
1602, 'You
1602, should
1602, learn
1602, not
1602, to
1602, make
1602, personal
1602, remarks,'
1602, Alice
1602, said
1602, with
1602, some
1603, severity;
1603, 'it's
1603, very
1603, rude.'
1604, 
1605, The
1605, Hatter
1605, opened
1605, his
1605, eyes
1605, very
1605, wide
1605, on
1605, hearing
1605, this;
1605, but
1605, all
1605, he
1605, SAID
1606, was,
1606, 'Why
1606, is
1606, a
1606, raven
1606, like
1606, a
1606, writing-desk?'
1607, 
1608, 'Come,
1608, we
1608, shall
1608, have
1608, some
1608, fun
1608, now!'
1608, thought
1608, Alice.
1608, 'I'm
1608, glad
1608, they've
1609, begun
1609, asking
1609, riddles.--I
1609, believe
1609, I
1609, can
1609, guess
1609, that,'
1609, she
1609, added
1609, aloud.
1610, 
1611, 'Do
1611, you
1611, mean
1611, that
1611, you
1611, think
1611, you
1611, can
1611, find
1611, out
1611, the
1611, answer
1611, to
1611, it?'
1611, said
1611, the
1612, March
1612, Hare.
1613, 
1614, 'Exactly
1614, so,'
1614, said
1614, Alice.
1615, 
1616, 'Then
1616, you
1616, should
1616, say
1616, what
1616, you
1616, mean,'
1616, the
1616, March
1616, Hare
1616, went
1616, on.
1617, 
1618, 'I
1618, do,'
1618, Alice
1618, hastily
1618, replied;
1618, 'at
1618, least--at
1618, least
1618, I
1618, mean
1618, what
1618, I
1619, say--that's
1619, the
1619, same
1619, thing,
1619, you
1619, know.'
1620, 
1621, 'Not
1621, the
1621, same
1621, thing
1621, a
1621, bit!'
1621, said
1621, the
1621, Hatter.
1621, 'You
1621, might
1621, just
1621, as
1621, well
1621, say
1622, that
1622, "I
1622, see
1622, what
1622, I
1622, eat"
1622, is
1622, the
1622, same
1622, thing
1622, as
1622, "I
1622, eat
1622, what
1622, I
1622, see"!'
1623, 
1624, 'You
1624, might
1624, just
1624, as
1624, well
1624, say,'
1624, added
1624, the
1624, March
1624, Hare,
1624, 'that
1624, "I
1624, like
1624, what
1624, I
1625, get"
1625, is
1625, the
1625, same
1625, thing
1625, as
1625, "I
1625, get
1625, what
1625, I
1625, like"!'
1626, 
1627, 'You
1627, might
1627, just
1627, as
1627, well
1627, say,'
1627, added
1627, the
1627, Dormouse,
1627, who
1627, seemed
1627, to
1627, be
1628, talking
1628, in
1628, his
1628, sleep,
1628, 'that
1628, "I
1628, breathe
1628, when
1628, I
1628, sleep"
1628, is
1628, the
1628, same
1628, thing
1629, as
1629, "I
1629, sleep
1629, when
1629, I
1629, breathe"!'
1630, 
1631, 'It
1631, IS
1631, the
1631, same
1631, thing
1631, with
1631, you,'
1631, said
1631, the
1631, Hatter,
1631, and
1631, here
1631, the
1632, conversation
1632, dropped,
1632, and
1632, the
1632, party
1632, sat
1632, silent
1632, for
1632, a
1632, minute,
1632, while
1632, Alice
1633, thought
1633, over
1633, all
1633, she
1633, could
1633, remember
1633, about
1633, ravens
1633, and
1633, writing-desks,
1634, which
1634, wasn't
1634, much.
1635, 
1636, The
1636, Hatter
1636, was
1636, the
1636, first
1636, to
1636, break
1636, the
1636, silence.
1636, 'What
1636, day
1636, of
1636, the
1636, month
1637, is
1637, it?'
1637, he
1637, said,
1637, turning
1637, to
1637, Alice:
1637, he
1637, had
1637, taken
1637, his
1637, watch
1637, out
1637, of
1637, his
1638, pocket,
1638, and
1638, was
1638, looking
1638, at
1638, it
1638, uneasily,
1638, shaking
1638, it
1638, every
1638, now
1638, and
1638, then,
1639, and
1639, holding
1639, it
1639, to
1639, his
1639, ear.
1640, 
1641, Alice
1641, considered
1641, a
1641, little,
1641, and
1641, then
1641, said
1641, 'The
1641, fourth.'
1642, 
1643, 'Two
1643, days
1643, wrong!'
1643, sighed
1643, the
1643, Hatter.
1643, 'I
1643, told
1643, you
1643, butter
1643, wouldn't
1643, suit
1644, the
1644, works!'
1644, he
1644, added
1644, looking
1644, angrily
1644, at
1644, the
1644, March
1644, Hare.
1645, 
1646, 'It
1646, was
1646, the
1646, BEST
1646, butter,'
1646, the
1646, March
1646, Hare
1646, meekly
1646, replied.
1647, 
1648, 'Yes,
1648, but
1648, some
1648, crumbs
1648, must
1648, have
1648, got
1648, in
1648, as
1648, well,'
1648, the
1648, Hatter
1648, grumbled:
1649, 'you
1649, shouldn't
1649, have
1649, put
1649, it
1649, in
1649, with
1649, the
1649, bread-knife.'
1650, 
1651, The
1651, March
1651, Hare
1651, took
1651, the
1651, watch
1651, and
1651, looked
1651, at
1651, it
1651, gloomily:
1651, then
1651, he
1651, dipped
1652, it
1652, into
1652, his
1652, cup
1652, of
1652, tea,
1652, and
1652, looked
1652, at
1652, it
1652, again:
1652, but
1652, he
1652, could
1652, think
1652, of
1653, nothing
1653, better
1653, to
1653, say
1653, than
1653, his
1653, first
1653, remark,
1653, 'It
1653, was
1653, the
1653, BEST
1653, butter,
1654, you
1654, know.'
1655, 
1656, Alice
1656, had
1656, been
1656, looking
1656, over
1656, his
1656, shoulder
1656, with
1656, some
1656, curiosity.
1656, 'What
1656, a
1657, funny
1657, watch!'
1657, she
1657, remarked.
1657, 'It
1657, tells
1657, the
1657, day
1657, of
1657, the
1657, month,
1657, and
1657, doesn't
1658, tell
1658, what
1658, o'clock
1658, it
1658, is!'
1659, 
1660, 'Why
1660, should
1660, it?'
1660, muttered
1660, the
1660, Hatter.
1660, 'Does
1660, YOUR
1660, watch
1660, tell
1660, you
1660, what
1661, year
1661, it
1661, is?'
1662, 
1663, 'Of
1663, course
1663, not,'
1663, Alice
1663, replied
1663, very
1663, readily:
1663, 'but
1663, that's
1663, because
1663, it
1664, stays
1664, the
1664, same
1664, year
1664, for
1664, such
1664, a
1664, long
1664, time
1664, together.'
1665, 
1666, 'Which
1666, is
1666, just
1666, the
1666, case
1666, with
1666, MINE,'
1666, said
1666, the
1666, Hatter.
1667, 
1668, Alice
1668, felt
1668, dreadfully
1668, puzzled.
1668, The
1668, Hatter's
1668, remark
1668, seemed
1668, to
1668, have
1668, no
1669, sort
1669, of
1669, meaning
1669, in
1669, it,
1669, and
1669, yet
1669, it
1669, was
1669, certainly
1669, English.
1669, 'I
1669, don't
1669, quite
1670, understand
1670, you,'
1670, she
1670, said,
1670, as
1670, politely
1670, as
1670, she
1670, could.
1671, 
1672, 'The
1672, Dormouse
1672, is
1672, asleep
1672, again,'
1672, said
1672, the
1672, Hatter,
1672, and
1672, he
1672, poured
1672, a
1672, little
1673, hot
1673, tea
1673, upon
1673, its
1673, nose.
1674, 
1675, The
1675, Dormouse
1675, shook
1675, its
1675, head
1675, impatiently,
1675, and
1675, said,
1675, without
1675, opening
1675, its
1676, eyes,
1676, 'Of
1676, course,
1676, of
1676, course;
1676, just
1676, what
1676, I
1676, was
1676, going
1676, to
1676, remark
1676, myself.'
1677, 
1678, 'Have
1678, you
1678, guessed
1678, the
1678, riddle
1678, yet?'
1678, the
1678, Hatter
1678, said,
1678, turning
1678, to
1678, Alice
1679, again.
1680, 
1681, 'No,
1681, I
1681, give
1681, it
1681, up,'
1681, Alice
1681, replied:
1681, 'what's
1681, the
1681, answer?'
1682, 
1683, 'I
1683, haven't
1683, the
1683, slightest
1683, idea,'
1683, said
1683, the
1683, Hatter.
1684, 
1685, 'Nor
1685, I,'
1685, said
1685, the
1685, March
1685, Hare.
1686, 
1687, Alice
1687, sighed
1687, wearily.
1687, 'I
1687, think
1687, you
1687, might
1687, do
1687, something
1687, better
1687, with
1687, the
1688, time,'
1688, she
1688, said,
1688, 'than
1688, waste
1688, it
1688, in
1688, asking
1688, riddles
1688, that
1688, have
1688, no
1688, answers.'
1689, 
1690, 'If
1690, you
1690, knew
1690, Time
1690, as
1690, well
1690, as
1690, I
1690, do,'
1690, said
1690, the
1690, Hatter,
1690, 'you
1690, wouldn't
1690, talk
1691, about
1691, wasting
1691, IT.
1691, It's
1691, HIM.'
1692, 
1693, 'I
1693, don't
1693, know
1693, what
1693, you
1693, mean,'
1693, said
1693, Alice.
1694, 
1695, 'Of
1695, course
1695, you
1695, don't!'
1695, the
1695, Hatter
1695, said,
1695, tossing
1695, his
1695, head
1695, contemptuously.
1696, 'I
1696, dare
1696, say
1696, you
1696, never
1696, even
1696, spoke
1696, to
1696, Time!'
1697, 
1698, 'Perhaps
1698, not,'
1698, Alice
1698, cautiously
1698, replied:
1698, 'but
1698, I
1698, know
1698, I
1698, have
1698, to
1698, beat
1698, time
1699, when
1699, I
1699, learn
1699, music.'
1700, 
1701, 'Ah!
1701, that
1701, accounts
1701, for
1701, it,'
1701, said
1701, the
1701, Hatter.
1701, 'He
1701, won't
1701, stand
1701, beating.
1702, Now,
1702, if
1702, you
1702, only
1702, kept
1702, on
1702, good
1702, terms
1702, with
1702, him,
1702, he'd
1702, do
1702, almost
1702, anything
1703, you
1703, liked
1703, with
1703, the
1703, clock.
1703, For
1703, instance,
1703, suppose
1703, it
1703, were
1703, nine
1703, o'clock
1703, in
1704, the
1704, morning,
1704, just
1704, time
1704, to
1704, begin
1704, lessons:
1704, you'd
1704, only
1704, have
1704, to
1704, whisper
1704, a
1705, hint
1705, to
1705, Time,
1705, and
1705, round
1705, goes
1705, the
1705, clock
1705, in
1705, a
1705, twinkling!
1705, Half-past
1705, one,
1706, time
1706, for
1706, dinner!'
1707, 
1708, ('I
1708, only
1708, wish
1708, it
1708, was,'
1708, the
1708, March
1708, Hare
1708, said
1708, to
1708, itself
1708, in
1708, a
1708, whisper.)
1709, 
1710, 'That
1710, would
1710, be
1710, grand,
1710, certainly,'
1710, said
1710, Alice
1710, thoughtfully:
1710, 'but
1710, then--I
1711, shouldn't
1711, be
1711, hungry
1711, for
1711, it,
1711, you
1711, know.'
1712, 
1713, 'Not
1713, at
1713, first,
1713, perhaps,'
1713, said
1713, the
1713, Hatter:
1713, 'but
1713, you
1713, could
1713, keep
1713, it
1713, to
1714, half-past
1714, one
1714, as
1714, long
1714, as
1714, you
1714, liked.'
1715, 
1716, 'Is
1716, that
1716, the
1716, way
1716, YOU
1716, manage?'
1716, Alice
1716, asked.
1717, 
1718, The
1718, Hatter
1718, shook
1718, his
1718, head
1718, mournfully.
1718, 'Not
1718, I!'
1718, he
1718, replied.
1718, 'We
1719, quarrelled
1719, last
1719, March--just
1719, before
1719, HE
1719, went
1719, mad,
1719, you
1719, know--'
1719, (pointing
1720, with
1720, his
1720, tea
1720, spoon
1720, at
1720, the
1720, March
1720, Hare,)
1720, '--it
1720, was
1720, at
1720, the
1720, great
1720, concert
1721, given
1721, by
1721, the
1721, Queen
1721, of
1721, Hearts,
1721, and
1721, I
1721, had
1721, to
1721, sing
1722, 
1723, "Twinkle,
1723, twinkle,
1723, little
1723, bat!
1724, How
1724, I
1724, wonder
1724, what
1724, you're
1724, at!"
1725, 
1726, You
1726, know
1726, the
1726, song,
1726, perhaps?'
1727, 
1728, 'I've
1728, heard
1728, something
1728, like
1728, it,'
1728, said
1728, Alice.
1729, 
1730, 'It
1730, goes
1730, on,
1730, you
1730, know,'
1730, the
1730, Hatter
1730, continued,
1730, 'in
1730, this
1730, way:--
1731, 
1732, "Up
1732, above
1732, the
1732, world
1732, you
1732, fly,
1733, Like
1733, a
1733, tea-tray
1733, in
1733, the
1733, sky.
1734, Twinkle,
1734, twinkle--"'
1735, 
1736, Here
1736, the
1736, Dormouse
1736, shook
1736, itself,
1736, and
1736, began
1736, singing
1736, in
1736, its
1736, sleep
1736, 'Twinkle,
1737, twinkle,
1737, twinkle,
1737, twinkle--'
1737, and
1737, went
1737, on
1737, so
1737, long
1737, that
1737, they
1737, had
1737, to
1737, pinch
1738, it
1738, to
1738, make
1738, it
1738, stop.
1739, 
1740, 'Well,
1740, I'd
1740, hardly
1740, finished
1740, the
1740, first
1740, verse,'
1740, said
1740, the
1740, Hatter,
1740, 'when
1740, the
1741, Queen
1741, jumped
1741, up
1741, and
1741, bawled
1741, out,
1741, "He's
1741, murdering
1741, the
1741, time!
1741, Off
1741, with
1741, his
1742, head!"'
1743, 
1744, 'How
1744, dreadfully
1744, savage!'
1744, exclaimed
1744, Alice.
1745, 
1746, 'And
1746, ever
1746, since
1746, that,'
1746, the
1746, Hatter
1746, went
1746, on
1746, in
1746, a
1746, mournful
1746, tone,
1746, 'he
1746, won't
1747, do
1747, a
1747, thing
1747, I
1747, ask!
1747, It's
1747, always
1747, six
1747, o'clock
1747, now.'
1748, 
1749, A
1749, bright
1749, idea
1749, came
1749, into
1749, Alice's
1749, head.
1749, 'Is
1749, that
1749, the
1749, reason
1749, so
1749, many
1750, tea-things
1750, are
1750, put
1750, out
1750, here?'
1750, she
1750, asked.
1751, 
1752, 'Yes,
1752, that's
1752, it,'
1752, said
1752, the
1752, Hatter
1752, with
1752, a
1752, sigh:
1752, 'it's
1752, always
1752, tea-time,
1753, and
1753, we've
1753, no
1753, time
1753, to
1753, wash
1753, the
1753, things
1753, between
1753, whiles.'
1754, 
1755, 'Then
1755, you
1755, keep
1755, moving
1755, round,
1755, I
1755, suppose?'
1755, said
1755, Alice.
1756, 
1757, 'Exactly
1757, so,'
1757, said
1757, the
1757, Hatter:
1757, 'as
1757, the
1757, things
1757, get
1757, used
1757, up.'
1758, 
1759, 'But
1759, what
1759, happens
1759, when
1759, you
1759, come
1759, to
1759, the
1759, beginning
1759, again?'
1759, Alice
1759, ventured
1760, to
1760, ask.
1761, 
1762, 'Suppose
1762, we
1762, change
1762, the
1762, subject,'
1762, the
1762, March
1762, Hare
1762, interrupted,
1762, yawning.
1763, 'I'm
1763, getting
1763, tired
1763, of
1763, this.
1763, I
1763, vote
1763, the
1763, young
1763, lady
1763, tells
1763, us
1763, a
1763, story.'
1764, 
1765, 'I'm
1765, afraid
1765, I
1765, don't
1765, know
1765, one,'
1765, said
1765, Alice,
1765, rather
1765, alarmed
1765, at
1765, the
1766, proposal.
1767, 
1768, 'Then
1768, the
1768, Dormouse
1768, shall!'
1768, they
1768, both
1768, cried.
1768, 'Wake
1768, up,
1768, Dormouse!'
1768, And
1769, they
1769, pinched
1769, it
1769, on
1769, both
1769, sides
1769, at
1769, once.
1770, 
1771, The
1771, Dormouse
1771, slowly
1771, opened
1771, his
1771, eyes.
1771, 'I
1771, wasn't
1771, asleep,'
1771, he
1771, said
1771, in
1771, a
1772, hoarse,
1772, feeble
1772, voice:
1772, 'I
1772, heard
1772, every
1772, word
1772, you
1772, fellows
1772, were
1772, saying.'
1773, 
1774, 'Tell
1774, us
1774, a
1774, story!'
1774, said
1774, the
1774, March
1774, Hare.
1775, 
1776, 'Yes,
1776, please
1776, do!'
1776, pleaded
1776, Alice.
1777, 
1778, 'And
1778, be
1778, quick
1778, about
1778, it,'
1778, added
1778, the
1778, Hatter,
1778, 'or
1778, you'll
1778, be
1778, asleep
1778, again
1779, before
1779, it's
1779, done.'
1780, 
1781, 'Once
1781, upon
1781, a
1781, time
1781, there
1781, were
1781, three
1781, little
1781, sisters,'
1781, the
1781, Dormouse
1781, began
1782, in
1782, a
1782, great
1782, hurry;
1782, 'and
1782, their
1782, names
1782, were
1782, Elsie,
1782, Lacie,
1782, and
1782, Tillie;
1782, and
1783, they
1783, lived
1783, at
1783, the
1783, bottom
1783, of
1783, a
1783, well--'
1784, 
1785, 'What
1785, did
1785, they
1785, live
1785, on?'
1785, said
1785, Alice,
1785, who
1785, always
1785, took
1785, a
1785, great
1785, interest
1785, in
1786, questions
1786, of
1786, eating
1786, and
1786, drinking.
1787, 
1788, 'They
1788, lived
1788, on
1788, treacle,'
1788, said
1788, the
1788, Dormouse,
1788, after
1788, thinking
1788, a
1788, minute
1788, or
1789, two.
1790, 
1791, 'They
1791, couldn't
1791, have
1791, done
1791, that,
1791, you
1791, know,'
1791, Alice
1791, gently
1791, remarked;
1791, 'they'd
1792, have
1792, been
1792, ill.'
1793, 
1794, 'So
1794, they
1794, were,'
1794, said
1794, the
1794, Dormouse;
1794, 'VERY
1794, ill.'
1795, 
1796, Alice
1796, tried
1796, to
1796, fancy
1796, to
1796, herself
1796, what
1796, such
1796, an
1796, extraordinary
1796, ways
1796, of
1797, living
1797, would
1797, be
1797, like,
1797, but
1797, it
1797, puzzled
1797, her
1797, too
1797, much,
1797, so
1797, she
1797, went
1797, on:
1797, 'But
1798, why
1798, did
1798, they
1798, live
1798, at
1798, the
1798, bottom
1798, of
1798, a
1798, well?'
1799, 
1800, 'Take
1800, some
1800, more
1800, tea,'
1800, the
1800, March
1800, Hare
1800, said
1800, to
1800, Alice,
1800, very
1800, earnestly.
1801, 
1802, 'I've
1802, had
1802, nothing
1802, yet,'
1802, Alice
1802, replied
1802, in
1802, an
1802, offended
1802, tone,
1802, 'so
1802, I
1802, can't
1803, take
1803, more.'
1804, 
1805, 'You
1805, mean
1805, you
1805, can't
1805, take
1805, LESS,'
1805, said
1805, the
1805, Hatter:
1805, 'it's
1805, very
1805, easy
1805, to
1805, take
1806, MORE
1806, than
1806, nothing.'
1807, 
1808, 'Nobody
1808, asked
1808, YOUR
1808, opinion,'
1808, said
1808, Alice.
1809, 
1810, 'Who's
1810, making
1810, personal
1810, remarks
1810, now?'
1810, the
1810, Hatter
1810, asked
1810, triumphantly.
1811, 
1812, Alice
1812, did
1812, not
1812, quite
1812, know
1812, what
1812, to
1812, say
1812, to
1812, this:
1812, so
1812, she
1812, helped
1812, herself
1813, to
1813, some
1813, tea
1813, and
1813, bread-and-butter,
1813, and
1813, then
1813, turned
1813, to
1813, the
1813, Dormouse,
1813, and
1814, repeated
1814, her
1814, question.
1814, 'Why
1814, did
1814, they
1814, live
1814, at
1814, the
1814, bottom
1814, of
1814, a
1814, well?'
1815, 
1816, The
1816, Dormouse
1816, again
1816, took
1816, a
1816, minute
1816, or
1816, two
1816, to
1816, think
1816, about
1816, it,
1816, and
1816, then
1817, said,
1817, 'It
1817, was
1817, a
1817, treacle-well.'
1818, 
1819, 'There's
1819, no
1819, such
1819, thing!'
1819, Alice
1819, was
1819, beginning
1819, very
1819, angrily,
1819, but
1819, the
1820, Hatter
1820, and
1820, the
1820, March
1820, Hare
1820, went
1820, 'Sh!
1820, sh!'
1820, and
1820, the
1820, Dormouse
1820, sulkily
1821, remarked,
1821, 'If
1821, you
1821, can't
1821, be
1821, civil,
1821, you'd
1821, better
1821, finish
1821, the
1821, story
1821, for
1822, yourself.'
1823, 
1824, 'No,
1824, please
1824, go
1824, on!'
1824, Alice
1824, said
1824, very
1824, humbly;
1824, 'I
1824, won't
1824, interrupt
1824, again.
1824, I
1825, dare
1825, say
1825, there
1825, may
1825, be
1825, ONE.'
1826, 
1827, 'One,
1827, indeed!'
1827, said
1827, the
1827, Dormouse
1827, indignantly.
1827, However,
1827, he
1827, consented
1827, to
1828, go
1828, on.
1828, 'And
1828, so
1828, these
1828, three
1828, little
1828, sisters--they
1828, were
1828, learning
1828, to
1828, draw,
1829, you
1829, know--'
1830, 
1831, 'What
1831, did
1831, they
1831, draw?'
1831, said
1831, Alice,
1831, quite
1831, forgetting
1831, her
1831, promise.
1832, 
1833, 'Treacle,'
1833, said
1833, the
1833, Dormouse,
1833, without
1833, considering
1833, at
1833, all
1833, this
1833, time.
1834, 
1835, 'I
1835, want
1835, a
1835, clean
1835, cup,'
1835, interrupted
1835, the
1835, Hatter:
1835, 'let's
1835, all
1835, move
1835, one
1835, place
1836, on.'
1837, 
1838, He
1838, moved
1838, on
1838, as
1838, he
1838, spoke,
1838, and
1838, the
1838, Dormouse
1838, followed
1838, him:
1838, the
1838, March
1838, Hare
1839, moved
1839, into
1839, the
1839, Dormouse's
1839, place,
1839, and
1839, Alice
1839, rather
1839, unwillingly
1839, took
1840, the
1840, place
1840, of
1840, the
1840, March
1840, Hare.
1840, The
1840, Hatter
1840, was
1840, the
1840, only
1840, one
1840, who
1840, got
1840, any
1841, advantage
1841, from
1841, the
1841, change:
1841, and
1841, Alice
1841, was
1841, a
1841, good
1841, deal
1841, worse
1841, off
1841, than
1842, before,
1842, as
1842, the
1842, March
1842, Hare
1842, had
1842, just
1842, upset
1842, the
1842, milk-jug
1842, into
1842, his
1842, plate.
1843, 
1844, Alice
1844, did
1844, not
1844, wish
1844, to
1844, offend
1844, the
1844, Dormouse
1844, again,
1844, so
1844, she
1844, began
1844, very
1845, cautiously:
1845, 'But
1845, I
1845, don't
1845, understand.
1845, Where
1845, did
1845, they
1845, draw
1845, the
1845, treacle
1846, from?'
1847, 
1848, 'You
1848, can
1848, draw
1848, water
1848, out
1848, of
1848, a
1848, water-well,'
1848, said
1848, the
1848, Hatter;
1848, 'so
1848, I
1848, should
1849, think
1849, you
1849, could
1849, draw
1849, treacle
1849, out
1849, of
1849, a
1849, treacle-well--eh,
1849, stupid?'
1850, 
1851, 'But
1851, they
1851, were
1851, IN
1851, the
1851, well,'
1851, Alice
1851, said
1851, to
1851, the
1851, Dormouse,
1851, not
1851, choosing
1851, to
1852, notice
1852, this
1852, last
1852, remark.
1853, 
1854, 'Of
1854, course
1854, they
1854, were',
1854, said
1854, the
1854, Dormouse;
1854, '--well
1854, in.'
1855, 
1856, This
1856, answer
1856, so
1856, confused
1856, poor
1856, Alice,
1856, that
1856, she
1856, let
1856, the
1856, Dormouse
1856, go
1856, on
1856, for
1857, some
1857, time
1857, without
1857, interrupting
1857, it.
1858, 
1859, 'They
1859, were
1859, learning
1859, to
1859, draw,'
1859, the
1859, Dormouse
1859, went
1859, on,
1859, yawning
1859, and
1859, rubbing
1860, its
1860, eyes,
1860, for
1860, it
1860, was
1860, getting
1860, very
1860, sleepy;
1860, 'and
1860, they
1860, drew
1860, all
1860, manner
1860, of
1861, things--everything
1861, that
1861, begins
1861, with
1861, an
1861, M--'
1862, 
1863, 'Why
1863, with
1863, an
1863, M?'
1863, said
1863, Alice.
1864, 
1865, 'Why
1865, not?'
1865, said
1865, the
1865, March
1865, Hare.
1866, 
1867, Alice
1867, was
1867, silent.
1868, 
1869, The
1869, Dormouse
1869, had
1869, closed
1869, its
1869, eyes
1869, by
1869, this
1869, time,
1869, and
1869, was
1869, going
1869, off
1869, into
1870, a
1870, doze;
1870, but,
1870, on
1870, being
1870, pinched
1870, by
1870, the
1870, Hatter,
1870, it
1870, woke
1870, up
1870, again
1870, with
1871, a
1871, little
1871, shriek,
1871, and
1871, went
1871, on:
1871, '--that
1871, begins
1871, with
1871, an
1871, M,
1871, such
1871, as
1872, mouse-traps,
1872, and
1872, the
1872, moon,
1872, and
1872, memory,
1872, and
1872, muchness--you
1872, know
1872, you
1872, say
1873, things
1873, are
1873, "much
1873, of
1873, a
1873, muchness"--did
1873, you
1873, ever
1873, see
1873, such
1873, a
1873, thing
1873, as
1873, a
1874, drawing
1874, of
1874, a
1874, muchness?'
1875, 
1876, 'Really,
1876, now
1876, you
1876, ask
1876, me,'
1876, said
1876, Alice,
1876, very
1876, much
1876, confused,
1876, 'I
1876, don't
1877, think--'
1878, 
1879, 'Then
1879, you
1879, shouldn't
1879, talk,'
1879, said
1879, the
1879, Hatter.
1880, 
1881, This
1881, piece
1881, of
1881, rudeness
1881, was
1881, more
1881, than
1881, Alice
1881, could
1881, bear:
1881, she
1881, got
1881, up
1881, in
1882, great
1882, disgust,
1882, and
1882, walked
1882, off;
1882, the
1882, Dormouse
1882, fell
1882, asleep
1882, instantly,
1882, and
1883, neither
1883, of
1883, the
1883, others
1883, took
1883, the
1883, least
1883, notice
1883, of
1883, her
1883, going,
1883, though
1883, she
1884, looked
1884, back
1884, once
1884, or
1884, twice,
1884, half
1884, hoping
1884, that
1884, they
1884, would
1884, call
1884, after
1884, her:
1885, the
1885, last
1885, time
1885, she
1885, saw
1885, them,
1885, they
1885, were
1885, trying
1885, to
1885, put
1885, the
1885, Dormouse
1885, into
1886, the
1886, teapot.
1887, 
1888, 'At
1888, any
1888, rate
1888, I'll
1888, never
1888, go
1888, THERE
1888, again!'
1888, said
1888, Alice
1888, as
1888, she
1888, picked
1888, her
1889, way
1889, through
1889, the
1889, wood.
1889, 'It's
1889, the
1889, stupidest
1889, tea-party
1889, I
1889, ever
1889, was
1889, at
1889, in
1889, all
1890, my
1890, life!'
1891, 
1892, Just
1892, as
1892, she
1892, said
1892, this,
1892, she
1892, noticed
1892, that
1892, one
1892, of
1892, the
1892, trees
1892, had
1892, a
1892, door
1893, leading
1893, right
1893, into
1893, it.
1893, 'That's
1893, very
1893, curious!'
1893, she
1893, thought.
1893, 'But
1894, everything's
1894, curious
1894, today.
1894, I
1894, think
1894, I
1894, may
1894, as
1894, well
1894, go
1894, in
1894, at
1894, once.'
1894, And
1894, in
1895, she
1895, went.
1896, 
1897, Once
1897, more
1897, she
1897, found
1897, herself
1897, in
1897, the
1897, long
1897, hall,
1897, and
1897, close
1897, to
1897, the
1897, little
1898, glass
1898, table.
1898, 'Now,
1898, I'll
1898, manage
1898, better
1898, this
1898, time,'
1898, she
1898, said
1898, to
1898, herself,
1899, and
1899, began
1899, by
1899, taking
1899, the
1899, little
1899, golden
1899, key,
1899, and
1899, unlocking
1899, the
1899, door
1899, that
1900, led
1900, into
1900, the
1900, garden.
1900, Then
1900, she
1900, went
1900, to
1900, work
1900, nibbling
1900, at
1900, the
1900, mushroom
1900, (she
1901, had
1901, kept
1901, a
1901, piece
1901, of
1901, it
1901, in
1901, her
1901, pocket)
1901, till
1901, she
1901, was
1901, about
1901, a
1901, foot
1901, high:
1902, then
1902, she
1902, walked
1902, down
1902, the
1902, little
1902, passage:
1902, and
1902, THEN--she
1902, found
1902, herself
1902, at
1903, last
1903, in
1903, the
1903, beautiful
1903, garden,
1903, among
1903, the
1903, bright
1903, flower-beds
1903, and
1903, the
1903, cool
1904, fountains.

1906, 
1907, 
1908, 
1909, CHAPTER
1909, VIII.
1909, The
1909, Queen's
1909, Croquet-Ground
1910, 
1911, A
1911, large
1911, rose-tree
1911, stood
1911, near
1911, the
1911, entrance
1911, of
1911, the
1911, garden:
1911, the
1911, roses
1912, growing
1912, on
1912, it
1912, were
1912, white,
1912, but
1912, there
1912, were
1912, three
1912, gardeners
1912, at
1912, it,
1912, busily
1913, painting
1913, them
1913, red.
1913, Alice
1913, thought
1913, this
1913, a
1913, very
1913, curious
1913, thing,
1913, and
1913, she
1913, went
1914, nearer
1914, to
1914, watch
1914, them,
1914, and
1914, just
1914, as
1914, she
1914, came
1914, up
1914, to
1914, them
1914, she
1914, heard
1914, one
1914, of
1915, them
1915, say,
1915, 'Look
1915, out
1915, now,
1915, Five!
1915, Don't
1915, go
1915, splashing
1915, paint
1915, over
1915, me
1915, like
1916, that!'
1917, 
1918, 'I
1918, couldn't
1918, help
1918, it,'
1918, said
1918, Five,
1918, in
1918, a
1918, sulky
1918, tone;
1918, 'Seven
1918, jogged
1918, my
1919, elbow.'
1920, 
1921, On
1921, which
1921, Seven
1921, looked
1921, up
1921, and
1921, said,
1921, 'That's
1921, right,
1921, Five!
1921, Always
1921, lay
1921, the
1922, blame
1922, on
1922, others!'
1923, 
1924, 'YOU'D
1924, better
1924, not
1924, talk!'
1924, said
1924, Five.
1924, 'I
1924, heard
1924, the
1924, Queen
1924, say
1924, only
1925, yesterday
1925, you
1925, deserved
1925, to
1925, be
1925, beheaded!'
1926, 
1927, 'What
1927, for?'
1927, said
1927, the
1927, one
1927, who
1927, had
1927, spoken
1927, first.
1928, 
1929, 'That's
1929, none
1929, of
1929, YOUR
1929, business,
1929, Two!'
1929, said
1929, Seven.
1930, 
1931, 'Yes,
1931, it
1931, IS
1931, his
1931, business!'
1931, said
1931, Five,
1931, 'and
1931, I'll
1931, tell
1931, him--it
1931, was
1931, for
1932, bringing
1932, the
1932, cook
1932, tulip-roots
1932, instead
1932, of
1932, onions.'
1933, 
1934, Seven
1934, flung
1934, down
1934, his
1934, brush,
1934, and
1934, had
1934, just
1934, begun
1934, 'Well,
1934, of
1934, all
1934, the
1934, unjust
1935, things--'
1935, when
1935, his
1935, eye
1935, chanced
1935, to
1935, fall
1935, upon
1935, Alice,
1935, as
1935, she
1935, stood
1935, watching
1936, them,
1936, and
1936, he
1936, checked
1936, himself
1936, suddenly:
1936, the
1936, others
1936, looked
1936, round
1936, also,
1936, and
1937, all
1937, of
1937, them
1937, bowed
1937, low.
1938, 
1939, 'Would
1939, you
1939, tell
1939, me,'
1939, said
1939, Alice,
1939, a
1939, little
1939, timidly,
1939, 'why
1939, you
1939, are
1939, painting
1940, those
1940, roses?'
1941, 
1942, Five
1942, and
1942, Seven
1942, said
1942, nothing,
1942, but
1942, looked
1942, at
1942, Two.
1942, Two
1942, began
1942, in
1942, a
1942, low
1943, voice,
1943, 'Why
1943, the
1943, fact
1943, is,
1943, you
1943, see,
1943, Miss,
1943, this
1943, here
1943, ought
1943, to
1943, have
1943, been
1943, a
1944, RED
1944, rose-tree,
1944, and
1944, we
1944, put
1944, a
1944, white
1944, one
1944, in
1944, by
1944, mistake;
1944, and
1944, if
1944, the
1944, Queen
1945, was
1945, to
1945, find
1945, it
1945, out,
1945, we
1945, should
1945, all
1945, have
1945, our
1945, heads
1945, cut
1945, off,
1945, you
1945, know.
1946, So
1946, you
1946, see,
1946, Miss,
1946, we're
1946, doing
1946, our
1946, best,
1946, afore
1946, she
1946, comes,
1946, to--'
1946, At
1946, this
1947, moment
1947, Five,
1947, who
1947, had
1947, been
1947, anxiously
1947, looking
1947, across
1947, the
1947, garden,
1947, called
1948, out
1948, 'The
1948, Queen!
1948, The
1948, Queen!'
1948, and
1948, the
1948, three
1948, gardeners
1948, instantly
1948, threw
1949, themselves
1949, flat
1949, upon
1949, their
1949, faces.
1949, There
1949, was
1949, a
1949, sound
1949, of
1949, many
1949, footsteps,
1950, and
1950, Alice
1950, looked
1950, round,
1950, eager
1950, to
1950, see
1950, the
1950, Queen.
1951, 
1952, First
1952, came
1952, ten
1952, soldiers
1952, carrying
1952, clubs;
1952, these
1952, were
1952, all
1952, shaped
1952, like
1953, the
1953, three
1953, gardeners,
1953, oblong
1953, and
1953, flat,
1953, with
1953, their
1953, hands
1953, and
1953, feet
1953, at
1953, the
1954, corners:
1954, next
1954, the
1954, ten
1954, courtiers;
1954, these
1954, were
1954, ornamented
1954, all
1954, over
1954, with
1955, diamonds,
1955, and
1955, walked
1955, two
1955, and
1955, two,
1955, as
1955, the
1955, soldiers
1955, did.
1955, After
1955, these
1955, came
1956, the
1956, royal
1956, children;
1956, there
1956, were
1956, ten
1956, of
1956, them,
1956, and
1956, the
1956, little
1956, dears
1956, came
1957, jumping
1957, merrily
1957, along
1957, hand
1957, in
1957, hand,
1957, in
1957, couples:
1957, they
1957, were
1957, all
1957, ornamented
1958, with
1958, hearts.
1958, Next
1958, came
1958, the
1958, guests,
1958, mostly
1958, Kings
1958, and
1958, Queens,
1958, and
1958, among
1959, them
1959, Alice
1959, recognised
1959, the
1959, White
1959, Rabbit:
1959, it
1959, was
1959, talking
1959, in
1959, a
1959, hurried
1960, nervous
1960, manner,
1960, smiling
1960, at
1960, everything
1960, that
1960, was
1960, said,
1960, and
1960, went
1960, by
1960, without
1961, noticing
1961, her.
1961, Then
1961, followed
1961, the
1961, Knave
1961, of
1961, Hearts,
1961, carrying
1961, the
1961, King's
1962, crown
1962, on
1962, a
1962, crimson
1962, velvet
1962, cushion;
1962, and,
1962, last
1962, of
1962, all
1962, this
1962, grand
1963, procession,
1963, came
1963, THE
1963, KING
1963, AND
1963, QUEEN
1963, OF
1963, HEARTS.
1964, 
1965, Alice
1965, was
1965, rather
1965, doubtful
1965, whether
1965, she
1965, ought
1965, not
1965, to
1965, lie
1965, down
1965, on
1965, her
1965, face
1966, like
1966, the
1966, three
1966, gardeners,
1966, but
1966, she
1966, could
1966, not
1966, remember
1966, ever
1966, having
1966, heard
1967, of
1967, such
1967, a
1967, rule
1967, at
1967, processions;
1967, 'and
1967, besides,
1967, what
1967, would
1967, be
1967, the
1967, use
1967, of
1968, a
1968, procession,'
1968, thought
1968, she,
1968, 'if
1968, people
1968, had
1968, all
1968, to
1968, lie
1968, down
1968, upon
1968, their
1969, faces,
1969, so
1969, that
1969, they
1969, couldn't
1969, see
1969, it?'
1969, So
1969, she
1969, stood
1969, still
1969, where
1969, she
1969, was,
1970, and
1970, waited.
1971, 
1972, When
1972, the
1972, procession
1972, came
1972, opposite
1972, to
1972, Alice,
1972, they
1972, all
1972, stopped
1972, and
1972, looked
1973, at
1973, her,
1973, and
1973, the
1973, Queen
1973, said
1973, severely
1973, 'Who
1973, is
1973, this?'
1973, She
1973, said
1973, it
1973, to
1973, the
1974, Knave
1974, of
1974, Hearts,
1974, who
1974, only
1974, bowed
1974, and
1974, smiled
1974, in
1974, reply.
1975, 
1976, 'Idiot!'
1976, said
1976, the
1976, Queen,
1976, tossing
1976, her
1976, head
1976, impatiently;
1976, and,
1976, turning
1976, to
1977, Alice,
1977, she
1977, went
1977, on,
1977, 'What's
1977, your
1977, name,
1977, child?'
1978, 
1979, 'My
1979, name
1979, is
1979, Alice,
1979, so
1979, please
1979, your
1979, Majesty,'
1979, said
1979, Alice
1979, very
1979, politely;
1980, but
1980, she
1980, added,
1980, to
1980, herself,
1980, 'Why,
1980, they're
1980, only
1980, a
1980, pack
1980, of
1980, cards,
1980, after
1981, all.
1981, I
1981, needn't
1981, be
1981, afraid
1981, of
1981, them!'
1982, 
1983, 'And
1983, who
1983, are
1983, THESE?'
1983, said
1983, the
1983, Queen,
1983, pointing
1983, to
1983, the
1983, three
1983, gardeners
1983, who
1984, were
1984, lying
1984, round
1984, the
1984, rosetree;
1984, for,
1984, you
1984, see,
1984, as
1984, they
1984, were
1984, lying
1984, on
1984, their
1985, faces,
1985, and
1985, the
1985, pattern
1985, on
1985, their
1985, backs
1985, was
1985, the
1985, same
1985, as
1985, the
1985, rest
1985, of
1985, the
1986, pack,
1986, she
1986, could
1986, not
1986, tell
1986, whether
1986, they
1986, were
1986, gardeners,
1986, or
1986, soldiers,
1986, or
1987, courtiers,
1987, or
1987, three
1987, of
1987, her
1987, own
1987, children.
1988, 
1989, 'How
1989, should
1989, I
1989, know?'
1989, said
1989, Alice,
1989, surprised
1989, at
1989, her
1989, own
1989, courage.
1989, 'It's
1989, no
1990, business
1990, of
1990, MINE.'
1991, 
1992, The
1992, Queen
1992, turned
1992, crimson
1992, with
1992, fury,
1992, and,
1992, after
1992, glaring
1992, at
1992, her
1992, for
1992, a
1993, moment
1993, like
1993, a
1993, wild
1993, beast,
1993, screamed
1993, 'Off
1993, with
1993, her
1993, head!
1993, Off--'
1994, 
1995, 'Nonsense!'
1995, said
1995, Alice,
1995, very
1995, loudly
1995, and
1995, decidedly,
1995, and
1995, the
1995, Queen
1995, was
1996, silent.
1997, 
1998, The
1998, King
1998, laid
1998, his
1998, hand
1998, upon
1998, her
1998, arm,
1998, and
1998, timidly
1998, said
1998, 'Consider,
1998, my
1999, dear:
1999, she
1999, is
1999, only
1999, a
1999, child!'
2000, 
2001, The
2001, Queen
2001, turned
2001, angrily
2001, away
2001, from
2001, him,
2001, and
2001, said
2001, to
2001, the
2001, Knave
2001, 'Turn
2001, them
2002, over!'
2003, 
2004, The
2004, Knave
2004, did
2004, so,
2004, very
2004, carefully,
2004, with
2004, one
2004, foot.
2005, 
2006, 'Get
2006, up!'
2006, said
2006, the
2006, Queen,
2006, in
2006, a
2006, shrill,
2006, loud
2006, voice,
2006, and
2006, the
2006, three
2007, gardeners
2007, instantly
2007, jumped
2007, up,
2007, and
2007, began
2007, bowing
2007, to
2007, the
2007, King,
2007, the
2007, Queen,
2008, the
2008, royal
2008, children,
2008, and
2008, everybody
2008, else.
2009, 
2010, 'Leave
2010, off
2010, that!'
2010, screamed
2010, the
2010, Queen.
2010, 'You
2010, make
2010, me
2010, giddy.'
2010, And
2010, then,
2011, turning
2011, to
2011, the
2011, rose-tree,
2011, she
2011, went
2011, on,
2011, 'What
2011, HAVE
2011, you
2011, been
2011, doing
2011, here?'
2012, 
2013, 'May
2013, it
2013, please
2013, your
2013, Majesty,'
2013, said
2013, Two,
2013, in
2013, a
2013, very
2013, humble
2013, tone,
2013, going
2014, down
2014, on
2014, one
2014, knee
2014, as
2014, he
2014, spoke,
2014, 'we
2014, were
2014, trying--'
2015, 
2016, 'I
2016, see!'
2016, said
2016, the
2016, Queen,
2016, who
2016, had
2016, meanwhile
2016, been
2016, examining
2016, the
2016, roses.
2017, 'Off
2017, with
2017, their
2017, heads!'
2017, and
2017, the
2017, procession
2017, moved
2017, on,
2017, three
2017, of
2017, the
2018, soldiers
2018, remaining
2018, behind
2018, to
2018, execute
2018, the
2018, unfortunate
2018, gardeners,
2018, who
2018, ran
2019, to
2019, Alice
2019, for
2019, protection.
2020, 
2021, 'You
2021, shan't
2021, be
2021, beheaded!'
2021, said
2021, Alice,
2021, and
2021, she
2021, put
2021, them
2021, into
2021, a
2021, large
2022, flower-pot
2022, that
2022, stood
2022, near.
2022, The
2022, three
2022, soldiers
2022, wandered
2022, about
2022, for
2022, a
2023, minute
2023, or
2023, two,
2023, looking
2023, for
2023, them,
2023, and
2023, then
2023, quietly
2023, marched
2023, off
2023, after
2023, the
2024, others.
2025, 
2026, 'Are
2026, their
2026, heads
2026, off?'
2026, shouted
2026, the
2026, Queen.
2027, 
2028, 'Their
2028, heads
2028, are
2028, gone,
2028, if
2028, it
2028, please
2028, your
2028, Majesty!'
2028, the
2028, soldiers
2028, shouted
2029, in
2029, reply.
2030, 
2031, 'That's
2031, right!'
2031, shouted
2031, the
2031, Queen.
2031, 'Can
2031, you
2031, play
2031, croquet?'
2032, 
2033, The
2033, soldiers
2033, were
2033, silent,
2033, and
2033, looked
2033, at
2033, Alice,
2033, as
2033, the
2033, question
2033, was
2034, evidently
2034, meant
2034, for
2034, her.
2035, 
2036, 'Yes!'
2036, shouted
2036, Alice.
2037, 
2038, 'Come
2038, on,
2038, then!'
2038, roared
2038, the
2038, Queen,
2038, and
2038, Alice
2038, joined
2038, the
2038, procession,
2039, wondering
2039, very
2039, much
2039, what
2039, would
2039, happen
2039, next.
2040, 
2041, 'It's--it's
2041, a
2041, very
2041, fine
2041, day!'
2041, said
2041, a
2041, timid
2041, voice
2041, at
2041, her
2041, side.
2041, She
2041, was
2042, walking
2042, by
2042, the
2042, White
2042, Rabbit,
2042, who
2042, was
2042, peeping
2042, anxiously
2042, into
2042, her
2042, face.
2043, 
2044, 'Very,'
2044, said
2044, Alice:
2044, '--where's
2044, the
2044, Duchess?'
2045, 
2046, 'Hush!
2046, Hush!'
2046, said
2046, the
2046, Rabbit
2046, in
2046, a
2046, low,
2046, hurried
2046, tone.
2046, He
2046, looked
2047, anxiously
2047, over
2047, his
2047, shoulder
2047, as
2047, he
2047, spoke,
2047, and
2047, then
2047, raised
2047, himself
2047, upon
2048, tiptoe,
2048, put
2048, his
2048, mouth
2048, close
2048, to
2048, her
2048, ear,
2048, and
2048, whispered
2048, 'She's
2048, under
2049, sentence
2049, of
2049, execution.'
2050, 
2051, 'What
2051, for?'
2051, said
2051, Alice.
2052, 
2053, 'Did
2053, you
2053, say
2053, "What
2053, a
2053, pity!"?'
2053, the
2053, Rabbit
2053, asked.
2054, 
2055, 'No,
2055, I
2055, didn't,'
2055, said
2055, Alice:
2055, 'I
2055, don't
2055, think
2055, it's
2055, at
2055, all
2055, a
2055, pity.
2055, I
2055, said
2056, "What
2056, for?"'
2057, 
2058, 'She
2058, boxed
2058, the
2058, Queen's
2058, ears--'
2058, the
2058, Rabbit
2058, began.
2058, Alice
2058, gave
2058, a
2058, little
2059, scream
2059, of
2059, laughter.
2059, 'Oh,
2059, hush!'
2059, the
2059, Rabbit
2059, whispered
2059, in
2059, a
2059, frightened
2060, tone.
2060, 'The
2060, Queen
2060, will
2060, hear
2060, you!
2060, You
2060, see,
2060, she
2060, came
2060, rather
2060, late,
2060, and
2060, the
2061, Queen
2061, said--'
2062, 
2063, 'Get
2063, to
2063, your
2063, places!'
2063, shouted
2063, the
2063, Queen
2063, in
2063, a
2063, voice
2063, of
2063, thunder,
2063, and
2064, people
2064, began
2064, running
2064, about
2064, in
2064, all
2064, directions,
2064, tumbling
2064, up
2064, against
2064, each
2065, other;
2065, however,
2065, they
2065, got
2065, settled
2065, down
2065, in
2065, a
2065, minute
2065, or
2065, two,
2065, and
2065, the
2065, game
2066, began.
2066, Alice
2066, thought
2066, she
2066, had
2066, never
2066, seen
2066, such
2066, a
2066, curious
2066, croquet-ground
2066, in
2067, her
2067, life;
2067, it
2067, was
2067, all
2067, ridges
2067, and
2067, furrows;
2067, the
2067, balls
2067, were
2067, live
2067, hedgehogs,
2068, the
2068, mallets
2068, live
2068, flamingoes,
2068, and
2068, the
2068, soldiers
2068, had
2068, to
2068, double
2068, themselves
2069, up
2069, and
2069, to
2069, stand
2069, on
2069, their
2069, hands
2069, and
2069, feet,
2069, to
2069, make
2069, the
2069, arches.
2070, 
2071, The
2071, chief
2071, difficulty
2071, Alice
2071, found
2071, at
2071, first
2071, was
2071, in
2071, managing
2071, her
2071, flamingo:
2072, she
2072, succeeded
2072, in
2072, getting
2072, its
2072, body
2072, tucked
2072, away,
2072, comfortably
2072, enough,
2072, under
2073, her
2073, arm,
2073, with
2073, its
2073, legs
2073, hanging
2073, down,
2073, but
2073, generally,
2073, just
2073, as
2073, she
2073, had
2073, got
2074, its
2074, neck
2074, nicely
2074, straightened
2074, out,
2074, and
2074, was
2074, going
2074, to
2074, give
2074, the
2074, hedgehog
2074, a
2075, blow
2075, with
2075, its
2075, head,
2075, it
2075, WOULD
2075, twist
2075, itself
2075, round
2075, and
2075, look
2075, up
2075, in
2075, her
2075, face,
2076, with
2076, such
2076, a
2076, puzzled
2076, expression
2076, that
2076, she
2076, could
2076, not
2076, help
2076, bursting
2076, out
2077, laughing:
2077, and
2077, when
2077, she
2077, had
2077, got
2077, its
2077, head
2077, down,
2077, and
2077, was
2077, going
2077, to
2077, begin
2078, again,
2078, it
2078, was
2078, very
2078, provoking
2078, to
2078, find
2078, that
2078, the
2078, hedgehog
2078, had
2078, unrolled
2079, itself,
2079, and
2079, was
2079, in
2079, the
2079, act
2079, of
2079, crawling
2079, away:
2079, besides
2079, all
2079, this,
2079, there
2079, was
2080, generally
2080, a
2080, ridge
2080, or
2080, furrow
2080, in
2080, the
2080, way
2080, wherever
2080, she
2080, wanted
2080, to
2080, send
2080, the
2081, hedgehog
2081, to,
2081, and,
2081, as
2081, the
2081, doubled-up
2081, soldiers
2081, were
2081, always
2081, getting
2081, up
2082, and
2082, walking
2082, off
2082, to
2082, other
2082, parts
2082, of
2082, the
2082, ground,
2082, Alice
2082, soon
2082, came
2082, to
2082, the
2083, conclusion
2083, that
2083, it
2083, was
2083, a
2083, very
2083, difficult
2083, game
2083, indeed.
2084, 
2085, The
2085, players
2085, all
2085, played
2085, at
2085, once
2085, without
2085, waiting
2085, for
2085, turns,
2085, quarrelling
2086, all
2086, the
2086, while,
2086, and
2086, fighting
2086, for
2086, the
2086, hedgehogs;
2086, and
2086, in
2086, a
2086, very
2086, short
2087, time
2087, the
2087, Queen
2087, was
2087, in
2087, a
2087, furious
2087, passion,
2087, and
2087, went
2087, stamping
2087, about,
2087, and
2088, shouting
2088, 'Off
2088, with
2088, his
2088, head!'
2088, or
2088, 'Off
2088, with
2088, her
2088, head!'
2088, about
2088, once
2088, in
2088, a
2089, minute.
2090, 
2091, Alice
2091, began
2091, to
2091, feel
2091, very
2091, uneasy:
2091, to
2091, be
2091, sure,
2091, she
2091, had
2091, not
2091, as
2091, yet
2091, had
2091, any
2092, dispute
2092, with
2092, the
2092, Queen,
2092, but
2092, she
2092, knew
2092, that
2092, it
2092, might
2092, happen
2092, any
2092, minute,
2093, 'and
2093, then,'
2093, thought
2093, she,
2093, 'what
2093, would
2093, become
2093, of
2093, me?
2093, They're
2093, dreadfully
2094, fond
2094, of
2094, beheading
2094, people
2094, here;
2094, the
2094, great
2094, wonder
2094, is,
2094, that
2094, there's
2094, any
2094, one
2095, left
2095, alive!'
2096, 
2097, She
2097, was
2097, looking
2097, about
2097, for
2097, some
2097, way
2097, of
2097, escape,
2097, and
2097, wondering
2097, whether
2097, she
2098, could
2098, get
2098, away
2098, without
2098, being
2098, seen,
2098, when
2098, she
2098, noticed
2098, a
2098, curious
2098, appearance
2099, in
2099, the
2099, air:
2099, it
2099, puzzled
2099, her
2099, very
2099, much
2099, at
2099, first,
2099, but,
2099, after
2099, watching
2099, it
2100, a
2100, minute
2100, or
2100, two,
2100, she
2100, made
2100, it
2100, out
2100, to
2100, be
2100, a
2100, grin,
2100, and
2100, she
2100, said
2100, to
2100, herself
2101, 'It's
2101, the
2101, Cheshire
2101, Cat:
2101, now
2101, I
2101, shall
2101, have
2101, somebody
2101, to
2101, talk
2101, to.'
2102, 
2103, 'How
2103, are
2103, you
2103, getting
2103, on?'
2103, said
2103, the
2103, Cat,
2103, as
2103, soon
2103, as
2103, there
2103, was
2103, mouth
2104, enough
2104, for
2104, it
2104, to
2104, speak
2104, with.
2105, 
2106, Alice
2106, waited
2106, till
2106, the
2106, eyes
2106, appeared,
2106, and
2106, then
2106, nodded.
2106, 'It's
2106, no
2106, use
2107, speaking
2107, to
2107, it,'
2107, she
2107, thought,
2107, 'till
2107, its
2107, ears
2107, have
2107, come,
2107, or
2107, at
2107, least
2107, one
2108, of
2108, them.'
2108, In
2108, another
2108, minute
2108, the
2108, whole
2108, head
2108, appeared,
2108, and
2108, then
2108, Alice
2108, put
2109, down
2109, her
2109, flamingo,
2109, and
2109, began
2109, an
2109, account
2109, of
2109, the
2109, game,
2109, feeling
2109, very
2109, glad
2110, she
2110, had
2110, someone
2110, to
2110, listen
2110, to
2110, her.
2110, The
2110, Cat
2110, seemed
2110, to
2110, think
2110, that
2110, there
2110, was
2111, enough
2111, of
2111, it
2111, now
2111, in
2111, sight,
2111, and
2111, no
2111, more
2111, of
2111, it
2111, appeared.
2112, 
2113, 'I
2113, don't
2113, think
2113, they
2113, play
2113, at
2113, all
2113, fairly,'
2113, Alice
2113, began,
2113, in
2113, rather
2113, a
2114, complaining
2114, tone,
2114, 'and
2114, they
2114, all
2114, quarrel
2114, so
2114, dreadfully
2114, one
2114, can't
2114, hear
2115, oneself
2115, speak--and
2115, they
2115, don't
2115, seem
2115, to
2115, have
2115, any
2115, rules
2115, in
2115, particular;
2116, at
2116, least,
2116, if
2116, there
2116, are,
2116, nobody
2116, attends
2116, to
2116, them--and
2116, you've
2116, no
2116, idea
2116, how
2117, confusing
2117, it
2117, is
2117, all
2117, the
2117, things
2117, being
2117, alive;
2117, for
2117, instance,
2117, there's
2117, the
2118, arch
2118, I've
2118, got
2118, to
2118, go
2118, through
2118, next
2118, walking
2118, about
2118, at
2118, the
2118, other
2118, end
2118, of
2118, the
2119, ground--and
2119, I
2119, should
2119, have
2119, croqueted
2119, the
2119, Queen's
2119, hedgehog
2119, just
2119, now,
2119, only
2120, it
2120, ran
2120, away
2120, when
2120, it
2120, saw
2120, mine
2120, coming!'
2121, 
2122, 'How
2122, do
2122, you
2122, like
2122, the
2122, Queen?'
2122, said
2122, the
2122, Cat
2122, in
2122, a
2122, low
2122, voice.
2123, 
2124, 'Not
2124, at
2124, all,'
2124, said
2124, Alice:
2124, 'she's
2124, so
2124, extremely--'
2124, Just
2124, then
2124, she
2124, noticed
2125, that
2125, the
2125, Queen
2125, was
2125, close
2125, behind
2125, her,
2125, listening:
2125, so
2125, she
2125, went
2125, on,
2126, '--likely
2126, to
2126, win,
2126, that
2126, it's
2126, hardly
2126, worth
2126, while
2126, finishing
2126, the
2126, game.'
2127, 
2128, The
2128, Queen
2128, smiled
2128, and
2128, passed
2128, on.
2129, 
2130, 'Who
2130, ARE
2130, you
2130, talking
2130, to?'
2130, said
2130, the
2130, King,
2130, going
2130, up
2130, to
2130, Alice,
2130, and
2130, looking
2131, at
2131, the
2131, Cat's
2131, head
2131, with
2131, great
2131, curiosity.
2132, 
2133, 'It's
2133, a
2133, friend
2133, of
2133, mine--a
2133, Cheshire
2133, Cat,'
2133, said
2133, Alice:
2133, 'allow
2133, me
2133, to
2134, introduce
2134, it.'
2135, 
2136, 'I
2136, don't
2136, like
2136, the
2136, look
2136, of
2136, it
2136, at
2136, all,'
2136, said
2136, the
2136, King:
2136, 'however,
2136, it
2136, may
2137, kiss
2137, my
2137, hand
2137, if
2137, it
2137, likes.'
2138, 
2139, 'I'd
2139, rather
2139, not,'
2139, the
2139, Cat
2139, remarked.
2140, 
2141, 'Don't
2141, be
2141, impertinent,'
2141, said
2141, the
2141, King,
2141, 'and
2141, don't
2141, look
2141, at
2141, me
2141, like
2141, that!'
2142, He
2142, got
2142, behind
2142, Alice
2142, as
2142, he
2142, spoke.
2143, 
2144, 'A
2144, cat
2144, may
2144, look
2144, at
2144, a
2144, king,'
2144, said
2144, Alice.
2144, 'I've
2144, read
2144, that
2144, in
2144, some
2144, book,
2145, but
2145, I
2145, don't
2145, remember
2145, where.'
2146, 
2147, 'Well,
2147, it
2147, must
2147, be
2147, removed,'
2147, said
2147, the
2147, King
2147, very
2147, decidedly,
2147, and
2147, he
2147, called
2148, the
2148, Queen,
2148, who
2148, was
2148, passing
2148, at
2148, the
2148, moment,
2148, 'My
2148, dear!
2148, I
2148, wish
2148, you
2148, would
2149, have
2149, this
2149, cat
2149, removed!'
2150, 
2151, The
2151, Queen
2151, had
2151, only
2151, one
2151, way
2151, of
2151, settling
2151, all
2151, difficulties,
2151, great
2151, or
2151, small.
2152, 'Off
2152, with
2152, his
2152, head!'
2152, she
2152, said,
2152, without
2152, even
2152, looking
2152, round.
2153, 
2154, 'I'll
2154, fetch
2154, the
2154, executioner
2154, myself,'
2154, said
2154, the
2154, King
2154, eagerly,
2154, and
2154, he
2155, hurried
2155, off.
2156, 
2157, Alice
2157, thought
2157, she
2157, might
2157, as
2157, well
2157, go
2157, back,
2157, and
2157, see
2157, how
2157, the
2157, game
2157, was
2157, going
2158, on,
2158, as
2158, she
2158, heard
2158, the
2158, Queen's
2158, voice
2158, in
2158, the
2158, distance,
2158, screaming
2158, with
2159, passion.
2159, She
2159, had
2159, already
2159, heard
2159, her
2159, sentence
2159, three
2159, of
2159, the
2159, players
2159, to
2159, be
2160, executed
2160, for
2160, having
2160, missed
2160, their
2160, turns,
2160, and
2160, she
2160, did
2160, not
2160, like
2160, the
2160, look
2161, of
2161, things
2161, at
2161, all,
2161, as
2161, the
2161, game
2161, was
2161, in
2161, such
2161, confusion
2161, that
2161, she
2161, never
2161, knew
2162, whether
2162, it
2162, was
2162, her
2162, turn
2162, or
2162, not.
2162, So
2162, she
2162, went
2162, in
2162, search
2162, of
2162, her
2162, hedgehog.
2163, 
2164, The
2164, hedgehog
2164, was
2164, engaged
2164, in
2164, a
2164, fight
2164, with
2164, another
2164, hedgehog,
2164, which
2164, seemed
2165, to
2165, Alice
2165, an
2165, excellent
2165, opportunity
2165, for
2165, croqueting
2165, one
2165, of
2165, them
2165, with
2165, the
2166, other:
2166, the
2166, only
2166, difficulty
2166, was,
2166, that
2166, her
2166, flamingo
2166, was
2166, gone
2166, across
2166, to
2166, the
2167, other
2167, side
2167, of
2167, the
2167, garden,
2167, where
2167, Alice
2167, could
2167, see
2167, it
2167, trying
2167, in
2167, a
2167, helpless
2168, sort
2168, of
2168, way
2168, to
2168, fly
2168, up
2168, into
2168, a
2168, tree.
2169, 
2170, By
2170, the
2170, time
2170, she
2170, had
2170, caught
2170, the
2170, flamingo
2170, and
2170, brought
2170, it
2170, back,
2170, the
2170, fight
2171, was
2171, over,
2171, and
2171, both
2171, the
2171, hedgehogs
2171, were
2171, out
2171, of
2171, sight:
2171, 'but
2171, it
2171, doesn't
2172, matter
2172, much,'
2172, thought
2172, Alice,
2172, 'as
2172, all
2172, the
2172, arches
2172, are
2172, gone
2172, from
2172, this
2172, side
2173, of
2173, the
2173, ground.'
2173, So
2173, she
2173, tucked
2173, it
2173, away
2173, under
2173, her
2173, arm,
2173, that
2173, it
2173, might
2173, not
2174, escape
2174, again,
2174, and
2174, went
2174, back
2174, for
2174, a
2174, little
2174, more
2174, conversation
2174, with
2174, her
2175, friend.
2176, 
2177, When
2177, she
2177, got
2177, back
2177, to
2177, the
2177, Cheshire
2177, Cat,
2177, she
2177, was
2177, surprised
2177, to
2177, find
2177, quite
2177, a
2178, large
2178, crowd
2178, collected
2178, round
2178, it:
2178, there
2178, was
2178, a
2178, dispute
2178, going
2178, on
2178, between
2179, the
2179, executioner,
2179, the
2179, King,
2179, and
2179, the
2179, Queen,
2179, who
2179, were
2179, all
2179, talking
2179, at
2179, once,
2180, while
2180, all
2180, the
2180, rest
2180, were
2180, quite
2180, silent,
2180, and
2180, looked
2180, very
2180, uncomfortable.
2181, 
2182, The
2182, moment
2182, Alice
2182, appeared,
2182, she
2182, was
2182, appealed
2182, to
2182, by
2182, all
2182, three
2182, to
2182, settle
2183, the
2183, question,
2183, and
2183, they
2183, repeated
2183, their
2183, arguments
2183, to
2183, her,
2183, though,
2183, as
2183, they
2184, all
2184, spoke
2184, at
2184, once,
2184, she
2184, found
2184, it
2184, very
2184, hard
2184, indeed
2184, to
2184, make
2184, out
2184, exactly
2185, what
2185, they
2185, said.
2186, 
2187, The
2187, executioner's
2187, argument
2187, was,
2187, that
2187, you
2187, couldn't
2187, cut
2187, off
2187, a
2187, head
2187, unless
2188, there
2188, was
2188, a
2188, body
2188, to
2188, cut
2188, it
2188, off
2188, from:
2188, that
2188, he
2188, had
2188, never
2188, had
2188, to
2188, do
2188, such
2188, a
2189, thing
2189, before,
2189, and
2189, he
2189, wasn't
2189, going
2189, to
2189, begin
2189, at
2189, HIS
2189, time
2189, of
2189, life.
2190, 
2191, The
2191, King's
2191, argument
2191, was,
2191, that
2191, anything
2191, that
2191, had
2191, a
2191, head
2191, could
2191, be
2192, beheaded,
2192, and
2192, that
2192, you
2192, weren't
2192, to
2192, talk
2192, nonsense.
2193, 
2194, The
2194, Queen's
2194, argument
2194, was,
2194, that
2194, if
2194, something
2194, wasn't
2194, done
2194, about
2194, it
2194, in
2194, less
2195, than
2195, no
2195, time
2195, she'd
2195, have
2195, everybody
2195, executed,
2195, all
2195, round.
2195, (It
2195, was
2195, this
2195, last
2196, remark
2196, that
2196, had
2196, made
2196, the
2196, whole
2196, party
2196, look
2196, so
2196, grave
2196, and
2196, anxious.)
2197, 
2198, Alice
2198, could
2198, think
2198, of
2198, nothing
2198, else
2198, to
2198, say
2198, but
2198, 'It
2198, belongs
2198, to
2198, the
2198, Duchess:
2199, you'd
2199, better
2199, ask
2199, HER
2199, about
2199, it.'
2200, 
2201, 'She's
2201, in
2201, prison,'
2201, the
2201, Queen
2201, said
2201, to
2201, the
2201, executioner:
2201, 'fetch
2201, her
2201, here.'
2202, And
2202, the
2202, executioner
2202, went
2202, off
2202, like
2202, an
2202, arrow.
2203, 
2204, The
2204, Cat's
2204, head
2204, began
2204, fading
2204, away
2204, the
2204, moment
2204, he
2204, was
2204, gone,
2204, and,
2205, by
2205, the
2205, time
2205, he
2205, had
2205, come
2205, back
2205, with
2205, the
2205, Duchess,
2205, it
2205, had
2205, entirely
2206, disappeared;
2206, so
2206, the
2206, King
2206, and
2206, the
2206, executioner
2206, ran
2206, wildly
2206, up
2206, and
2206, down
2207, looking
2207, for
2207, it,
2207, while
2207, the
2207, rest
2207, of
2207, the
2207, party
2207, went
2207, back
2207, to
2207, the
2207, game.
2208, 
2209, 
2210, 
2211, 
2212, CHAPTER
2212, IX.
2212, The
2212, Mock
2212, Turtle's
2212, Story
2213, 
2214, 'You
2214, can't
2214, think
2214, how
2214, glad
2214, I
2214, am
2214, to
2214, see
2214, you
2214, again,
2214, you
2214, dear
2214, old
2214, thing!'
2215, said
2215, the
2215, Duchess,
2215, as
2215, she
2215, tucked
2215, her
2215, arm
2215, affectionately
2215, into
2215, Alice's,
2215, and
2216, they
2216, walked
2216, off
2216, together.
2217, 
2218, Alice
2218, was
2218, very
2218, glad
2218, to
2218, find
2218, her
2218, in
2218, such
2218, a
2218, pleasant
2218, temper,
2218, and
2218, thought
2219, to
2219, herself
2219, that
2219, perhaps
2219, it
2219, was
2219, only
2219, the
2219, pepper
2219, that
2219, had
2219, made
2219, her
2219, so
2220, savage
2220, when
2220, they
2220, met
2220, in
2220, the
2220, kitchen.
2221, 
2222, 'When
2222, I'M
2222, a
2222, Duchess,'
2222, she
2222, said
2222, to
2222, herself,
2222, (not
2222, in
2222, a
2222, very
2222, hopeful
2222, tone
2223, though),
2223, 'I
2223, won't
2223, have
2223, any
2223, pepper
2223, in
2223, my
2223, kitchen
2223, AT
2223, ALL.
2223, Soup
2223, does
2223, very
2224, well
2224, without--Maybe
2224, it's
2224, always
2224, pepper
2224, that
2224, makes
2224, people
2224, hot-tempered,'
2225, she
2225, went
2225, on,
2225, very
2225, much
2225, pleased
2225, at
2225, having
2225, found
2225, out
2225, a
2225, new
2225, kind
2225, of
2226, rule,
2226, 'and
2226, vinegar
2226, that
2226, makes
2226, them
2226, sour--and
2226, camomile
2226, that
2226, makes
2227, them
2227, bitter--and--and
2227, barley-sugar
2227, and
2227, such
2227, things
2227, that
2227, make
2227, children
2228, sweet-tempered.
2228, I
2228, only
2228, wish
2228, people
2228, knew
2228, that:
2228, then
2228, they
2228, wouldn't
2228, be
2228, so
2229, stingy
2229, about
2229, it,
2229, you
2229, know--'
2230, 
2231, She
2231, had
2231, quite
2231, forgotten
2231, the
2231, Duchess
2231, by
2231, this
2231, time,
2231, and
2231, was
2231, a
2231, little
2232, startled
2232, when
2232, she
2232, heard
2232, her
2232, voice
2232, close
2232, to
2232, her
2232, ear.
2232, 'You're
2232, thinking
2233, about
2233, something,
2233, my
2233, dear,
2233, and
2233, that
2233, makes
2233, you
2233, forget
2233, to
2233, talk.
2233, I
2233, can't
2234, tell
2234, you
2234, just
2234, now
2234, what
2234, the
2234, moral
2234, of
2234, that
2234, is,
2234, but
2234, I
2234, shall
2234, remember
2234, it
2234, in
2235, a
2235, bit.'
2236, 
2237, 'Perhaps
2237, it
2237, hasn't
2237, one,'
2237, Alice
2237, ventured
2237, to
2237, remark.
2238, 
2239, 'Tut,
2239, tut,
2239, child!'
2239, said
2239, the
2239, Duchess.
2239, 'Everything's
2239, got
2239, a
2239, moral,
2239, if
2239, only
2240, you
2240, can
2240, find
2240, it.'
2240, And
2240, she
2240, squeezed
2240, herself
2240, up
2240, closer
2240, to
2240, Alice's
2240, side
2240, as
2241, she
2241, spoke.
2242, 
2243, Alice
2243, did
2243, not
2243, much
2243, like
2243, keeping
2243, so
2243, close
2243, to
2243, her:
2243, first,
2243, because
2243, the
2244, Duchess
2244, was
2244, VERY
2244, ugly;
2244, and
2244, secondly,
2244, because
2244, she
2244, was
2244, exactly
2244, the
2245, right
2245, height
2245, to
2245, rest
2245, her
2245, chin
2245, upon
2245, Alice's
2245, shoulder,
2245, and
2245, it
2245, was
2245, an
2246, uncomfortably
2246, sharp
2246, chin.
2246, However,
2246, she
2246, did
2246, not
2246, like
2246, to
2246, be
2246, rude,
2246, so
2246, she
2247, bore
2247, it
2247, as
2247, well
2247, as
2247, she
2247, could.
2248, 
2249, 'The
2249, game's
2249, going
2249, on
2249, rather
2249, better
2249, now,'
2249, she
2249, said,
2249, by
2249, way
2249, of
2249, keeping
2249, up
2250, the
2250, conversation
2250, a
2250, little.
2251, 
2252, ''Tis
2252, so,'
2252, said
2252, the
2252, Duchess:
2252, 'and
2252, the
2252, moral
2252, of
2252, that
2252, is--"Oh,
2252, 'tis
2252, love,
2253, 'tis
2253, love,
2253, that
2253, makes
2253, the
2253, world
2253, go
2253, round!"'
2254, 
2255, 'Somebody
2255, said,'
2255, Alice
2255, whispered,
2255, 'that
2255, it's
2255, done
2255, by
2255, everybody
2255, minding
2256, their
2256, own
2256, business!'
2257, 
2258, 'Ah,
2258, well!
2258, It
2258, means
2258, much
2258, the
2258, same
2258, thing,'
2258, said
2258, the
2258, Duchess,
2258, digging
2258, her
2259, sharp
2259, little
2259, chin
2259, into
2259, Alice's
2259, shoulder
2259, as
2259, she
2259, added,
2259, 'and
2259, the
2259, moral
2260, of
2260, THAT
2260, is--"Take
2260, care
2260, of
2260, the
2260, sense,
2260, and
2260, the
2260, sounds
2260, will
2260, take
2260, care
2260, of
2261, themselves."'
2262, 
2263, 'How
2263, fond
2263, she
2263, is
2263, of
2263, finding
2263, morals
2263, in
2263, things!'
2263, Alice
2263, thought
2263, to
2263, herself.
2264, 
2265, 'I
2265, dare
2265, say
2265, you're
2265, wondering
2265, why
2265, I
2265, don't
2265, put
2265, my
2265, arm
2265, round
2265, your
2265, waist,'
2266, the
2266, Duchess
2266, said
2266, after
2266, a
2266, pause:
2266, 'the
2266, reason
2266, is,
2266, that
2266, I'm
2266, doubtful
2266, about
2267, the
2267, temper
2267, of
2267, your
2267, flamingo.
2267, Shall
2267, I
2267, try
2267, the
2267, experiment?'
2268, 
2269, 'HE
2269, might
2269, bite,'
2269, Alice
2269, cautiously
2269, replied,
2269, not
2269, feeling
2269, at
2269, all
2269, anxious
2269, to
2270, have
2270, the
2270, experiment
2270, tried.
2271, 
2272, 'Very
2272, true,'
2272, said
2272, the
2272, Duchess:
2272, 'flamingoes
2272, and
2272, mustard
2272, both
2272, bite.
2272, And
2273, the
2273, moral
2273, of
2273, that
2273, is--"Birds
2273, of
2273, a
2273, feather
2273, flock
2273, together."'
2274, 
2275, 'Only
2275, mustard
2275, isn't
2275, a
2275, bird,'
2275, Alice
2275, remarked.
2276, 
2277, 'Right,
2277, as
2277, usual,'
2277, said
2277, the
2277, Duchess:
2277, 'what
2277, a
2277, clear
2277, way
2277, you
2277, have
2277, of
2278, putting
2278, things!'
2279, 
2280, 'It's
2280, a
2280, mineral,
2280, I
2280, THINK,'
2280, said
2280, Alice.
2281, 
2282, 'Of
2282, course
2282, it
2282, is,'
2282, said
2282, the
2282, Duchess,
2282, who
2282, seemed
2282, ready
2282, to
2282, agree
2282, to
2283, everything
2283, that
2283, Alice
2283, said;
2283, 'there's
2283, a
2283, large
2283, mustard-mine
2283, near
2283, here.
2283, And
2284, the
2284, moral
2284, of
2284, that
2284, is--"The
2284, more
2284, there
2284, is
2284, of
2284, mine,
2284, the
2284, less
2284, there
2284, is
2284, of
2285, yours."'
2286, 
2287, 'Oh,
2287, I
2287, know!'
2287, exclaimed
2287, Alice,
2287, who
2287, had
2287, not
2287, attended
2287, to
2287, this
2287, last
2287, remark,
2288, 'it's
2288, a
2288, vegetable.
2288, It
2288, doesn't
2288, look
2288, like
2288, one,
2288, but
2288, it
2288, is.'
2289, 
2290, 'I
2290, quite
2290, agree
2290, with
2290, you,'
2290, said
2290, the
2290, Duchess;
2290, 'and
2290, the
2290, moral
2290, of
2290, that
2291, is--"Be
2291, what
2291, you
2291, would
2291, seem
2291, to
2291, be"--or
2291, if
2291, you'd
2291, like
2291, it
2291, put
2291, more
2292, simply--"Never
2292, imagine
2292, yourself
2292, not
2292, to
2292, be
2292, otherwise
2292, than
2292, what
2292, it
2292, might
2293, appear
2293, to
2293, others
2293, that
2293, what
2293, you
2293, were
2293, or
2293, might
2293, have
2293, been
2293, was
2293, not
2293, otherwise
2294, than
2294, what
2294, you
2294, had
2294, been
2294, would
2294, have
2294, appeared
2294, to
2294, them
2294, to
2294, be
2294, otherwise."'
2295, 
2296, 'I
2296, think
2296, I
2296, should
2296, understand
2296, that
2296, better,'
2296, Alice
2296, said
2296, very
2296, politely,
2296, 'if
2297, I
2297, had
2297, it
2297, written
2297, down:
2297, but
2297, I
2297, can't
2297, quite
2297, follow
2297, it
2297, as
2297, you
2297, say
2297, it.'
2298, 
2299, 'That's
2299, nothing
2299, to
2299, what
2299, I
2299, could
2299, say
2299, if
2299, I
2299, chose,'
2299, the
2299, Duchess
2299, replied,
2299, in
2300, a
2300, pleased
2300, tone.
2301, 
2302, 'Pray
2302, don't
2302, trouble
2302, yourself
2302, to
2302, say
2302, it
2302, any
2302, longer
2302, than
2302, that,'
2302, said
2303, Alice.
2304, 
2305, 'Oh,
2305, don't
2305, talk
2305, about
2305, trouble!'
2305, said
2305, the
2305, Duchess.
2305, 'I
2305, make
2305, you
2305, a
2305, present
2306, of
2306, everything
2306, I've
2306, said
2306, as
2306, yet.'
2307, 
2308, 'A
2308, cheap
2308, sort
2308, of
2308, present!'
2308, thought
2308, Alice.
2308, 'I'm
2308, glad
2308, they
2308, don't
2308, give
2309, birthday
2309, presents
2309, like
2309, that!'
2309, But
2309, she
2309, did
2309, not
2309, venture
2309, to
2309, say
2309, it
2309, out
2310, loud.
2311, 
2312, 'Thinking
2312, again?'
2312, the
2312, Duchess
2312, asked,
2312, with
2312, another
2312, dig
2312, of
2312, her
2312, sharp
2313, little
2313, chin.
2314, 
2315, 'I've
2315, a
2315, right
2315, to
2315, think,'
2315, said
2315, Alice
2315, sharply,
2315, for
2315, she
2315, was
2315, beginning
2315, to
2316, feel
2316, a
2316, little
2316, worried.
2317, 
2318, 'Just
2318, about
2318, as
2318, much
2318, right,'
2318, said
2318, the
2318, Duchess,
2318, 'as
2318, pigs
2318, have
2318, to
2318, fly;
2318, and
2319, the
2319, m--'
2320, 
2321, But
2321, here,
2321, to
2321, Alice's
2321, great
2321, surprise,
2321, the
2321, Duchess's
2321, voice
2321, died
2321, away,
2321, even
2322, in
2322, the
2322, middle
2322, of
2322, her
2322, favourite
2322, word
2322, 'moral,'
2322, and
2322, the
2322, arm
2322, that
2322, was
2322, linked
2323, into
2323, hers
2323, began
2323, to
2323, tremble.
2323, Alice
2323, looked
2323, up,
2323, and
2323, there
2323, stood
2323, the
2323, Queen
2324, in
2324, front
2324, of
2324, them,
2324, with
2324, her
2324, arms
2324, folded,
2324, frowning
2324, like
2324, a
2324, thunderstorm.
2325, 
2326, 'A
2326, fine
2326, day,
2326, your
2326, Majesty!'
2326, the
2326, Duchess
2326, began
2326, in
2326, a
2326, low,
2326, weak
2326, voice.
2327, 
2328, 'Now,
2328, I
2328, give
2328, you
2328, fair
2328, warning,'
2328, shouted
2328, the
2328, Queen,
2328, stamping
2328, on
2328, the
2329, ground
2329, as
2329, she
2329, spoke;
2329, 'either
2329, you
2329, or
2329, your
2329, head
2329, must
2329, be
2329, off,
2329, and
2329, that
2329, in
2330, about
2330, half
2330, no
2330, time!
2330, Take
2330, your
2330, choice!'
2331, 
2332, The
2332, Duchess
2332, took
2332, her
2332, choice,
2332, and
2332, was
2332, gone
2332, in
2332, a
2332, moment.
2333, 
2334, 'Let's
2334, go
2334, on
2334, with
2334, the
2334, game,'
2334, the
2334, Queen
2334, said
2334, to
2334, Alice;
2334, and
2334, Alice
2334, was
2335, too
2335, much
2335, frightened
2335, to
2335, say
2335, a
2335, word,
2335, but
2335, slowly
2335, followed
2335, her
2335, back
2335, to
2335, the
2336, croquet-ground.
2337, 
2338, The
2338, other
2338, guests
2338, had
2338, taken
2338, advantage
2338, of
2338, the
2338, Queen's
2338, absence,
2338, and
2338, were
2339, resting
2339, in
2339, the
2339, shade:
2339, however,
2339, the
2339, moment
2339, they
2339, saw
2339, her,
2339, they
2339, hurried
2340, back
2340, to
2340, the
2340, game,
2340, the
2340, Queen
2340, merely
2340, remarking
2340, that
2340, a
2340, moment's
2340, delay
2340, would
2341, cost
2341, them
2341, their
2341, lives.
2342, 
2343, All
2343, the
2343, time
2343, they
2343, were
2343, playing
2343, the
2343, Queen
2343, never
2343, left
2343, off
2343, quarrelling
2343, with
2344, the
2344, other
2344, players,
2344, and
2344, shouting
2344, 'Off
2344, with
2344, his
2344, head!'
2344, or
2344, 'Off
2344, with
2344, her
2345, head!'
2345, Those
2345, whom
2345, she
2345, sentenced
2345, were
2345, taken
2345, into
2345, custody
2345, by
2345, the
2345, soldiers,
2346, who
2346, of
2346, course
2346, had
2346, to
2346, leave
2346, off
2346, being
2346, arches
2346, to
2346, do
2346, this,
2346, so
2346, that
2346, by
2347, the
2347, end
2347, of
2347, half
2347, an
2347, hour
2347, or
2347, so
2347, there
2347, were
2347, no
2347, arches
2347, left,
2347, and
2347, all
2347, the
2348, players,
2348, except
2348, the
2348, King,
2348, the
2348, Queen,
2348, and
2348, Alice,
2348, were
2348, in
2348, custody
2348, and
2349, under
2349, sentence
2349, of
2349, execution.
2350, 
2351, Then
2351, the
2351, Queen
2351, left
2351, off,
2351, quite
2351, out
2351, of
2351, breath,
2351, and
2351, said
2351, to
2351, Alice,
2351, 'Have
2352, you
2352, seen
2352, the
2352, Mock
2352, Turtle
2352, yet?'
2353, 
2354, 'No,'
2354, said
2354, Alice.
2354, 'I
2354, don't
2354, even
2354, know
2354, what
2354, a
2354, Mock
2354, Turtle
2354, is.'
2355, 
2356, 'It's
2356, the
2356, thing
2356, Mock
2356, Turtle
2356, Soup
2356, is
2356, made
2356, from,'
2356, said
2356, the
2356, Queen.
2357, 
2358, 'I
2358, never
2358, saw
2358, one,
2358, or
2358, heard
2358, of
2358, one,'
2358, said
2358, Alice.
2359, 
2360, 'Come
2360, on,
2360, then,'
2360, said
2360, the
2360, Queen,
2360, 'and
2360, he
2360, shall
2360, tell
2360, you
2360, his
2360, history,'
2361, 
2362, As
2362, they
2362, walked
2362, off
2362, together,
2362, Alice
2362, heard
2362, the
2362, King
2362, say
2362, in
2362, a
2362, low
2362, voice,
2363, to
2363, the
2363, company
2363, generally,
2363, 'You
2363, are
2363, all
2363, pardoned.'
2363, 'Come,
2363, THAT'S
2363, a
2363, good
2364, thing!'
2364, she
2364, said
2364, to
2364, herself,
2364, for
2364, she
2364, had
2364, felt
2364, quite
2364, unhappy
2364, at
2364, the
2365, number
2365, of
2365, executions
2365, the
2365, Queen
2365, had
2365, ordered.
2366, 
2367, They
2367, very
2367, soon
2367, came
2367, upon
2367, a
2367, Gryphon,
2367, lying
2367, fast
2367, asleep
2367, in
2367, the
2367, sun.
2368, (IF
2368, you
2368, don't
2368, know
2368, what
2368, a
2368, Gryphon
2368, is,
2368, look
2368, at
2368, the
2368, picture.)
2368, 'Up,
2368, lazy
2369, thing!'
2369, said
2369, the
2369, Queen,
2369, 'and
2369, take
2369, this
2369, young
2369, lady
2369, to
2369, see
2369, the
2369, Mock
2370, Turtle,
2370, and
2370, to
2370, hear
2370, his
2370, history.
2370, I
2370, must
2370, go
2370, back
2370, and
2370, see
2370, after
2370, some
2371, executions
2371, I
2371, have
2371, ordered';
2371, and
2371, she
2371, walked
2371, off,
2371, leaving
2371, Alice
2371, alone
2371, with
2372, the
2372, Gryphon.
2372, Alice
2372, did
2372, not
2372, quite
2372, like
2372, the
2372, look
2372, of
2372, the
2372, creature,
2372, but
2372, on
2373, the
2373, whole
2373, she
2373, thought
2373, it
2373, would
2373, be
2373, quite
2373, as
2373, safe
2373, to
2373, stay
2373, with
2373, it
2373, as
2373, to
2373, go
2374, after
2374, that
2374, savage
2374, Queen:
2374, so
2374, she
2374, waited.
2375, 
2376, The
2376, Gryphon
2376, sat
2376, up
2376, and
2376, rubbed
2376, its
2376, eyes:
2376, then
2376, it
2376, watched
2376, the
2376, Queen
2376, till
2377, she
2377, was
2377, out
2377, of
2377, sight:
2377, then
2377, it
2377, chuckled.
2377, 'What
2377, fun!'
2377, said
2377, the
2377, Gryphon,
2378, half
2378, to
2378, itself,
2378, half
2378, to
2378, Alice.
2379, 
2380, 'What
2380, IS
2380, the
2380, fun?'
2380, said
2380, Alice.
2381, 
2382, 'Why,
2382, SHE,'
2382, said
2382, the
2382, Gryphon.
2382, 'It's
2382, all
2382, her
2382, fancy,
2382, that:
2382, they
2382, never
2383, executes
2383, nobody,
2383, you
2383, know.
2383, Come
2383, on!'
2384, 
2385, 'Everybody
2385, says
2385, "come
2385, on!"
2385, here,'
2385, thought
2385, Alice,
2385, as
2385, she
2385, went
2385, slowly
2386, after
2386, it:
2386, 'I
2386, never
2386, was
2386, so
2386, ordered
2386, about
2386, in
2386, all
2386, my
2386, life,
2386, never!'
2387, 
2388, They
2388, had
2388, not
2388, gone
2388, far
2388, before
2388, they
2388, saw
2388, the
2388, Mock
2388, Turtle
2388, in
2388, the
2388, distance,
2389, sitting
2389, sad
2389, and
2389, lonely
2389, on
2389, a
2389, little
2389, ledge
2389, of
2389, rock,
2389, and,
2389, as
2389, they
2389, came
2390, nearer,
2390, Alice
2390, could
2390, hear
2390, him
2390, sighing
2390, as
2390, if
2390, his
2390, heart
2390, would
2390, break.
2390, She
2391, pitied
2391, him
2391, deeply.
2391, 'What
2391, is
2391, his
2391, sorrow?'
2391, she
2391, asked
2391, the
2391, Gryphon,
2391, and
2391, the
2392, Gryphon
2392, answered,
2392, very
2392, nearly
2392, in
2392, the
2392, same
2392, words
2392, as
2392, before,
2392, 'It's
2392, all
2392, his
2393, fancy,
2393, that:
2393, he
2393, hasn't
2393, got
2393, no
2393, sorrow,
2393, you
2393, know.
2393, Come
2393, on!'
2394, 
2395, So
2395, they
2395, went
2395, up
2395, to
2395, the
2395, Mock
2395, Turtle,
2395, who
2395, looked
2395, at
2395, them
2395, with
2395, large
2395, eyes
2396, full
2396, of
2396, tears,
2396, but
2396, said
2396, nothing.
2397, 
2398, 'This
2398, here
2398, young
2398, lady,'
2398, said
2398, the
2398, Gryphon,
2398, 'she
2398, wants
2398, for
2398, to
2398, know
2398, your
2399, history,
2399, she
2399, do.'
2400, 
2401, 'I'll
2401, tell
2401, it
2401, her,'
2401, said
2401, the
2401, Mock
2401, Turtle
2401, in
2401, a
2401, deep,
2401, hollow
2401, tone:
2401, 'sit
2402, down,
2402, both
2402, of
2402, you,
2402, and
2402, don't
2402, speak
2402, a
2402, word
2402, till
2402, I've
2402, finished.'
2403, 
2404, So
2404, they
2404, sat
2404, down,
2404, and
2404, nobody
2404, spoke
2404, for
2404, some
2404, minutes.
2404, Alice
2404, thought
2404, to
2405, herself,
2405, 'I
2405, don't
2405, see
2405, how
2405, he
2405, can
2405, EVEN
2405, finish,
2405, if
2405, he
2405, doesn't
2405, begin.'
2405, But
2406, she
2406, waited
2406, patiently.
2407, 
2408, 'Once,'
2408, said
2408, the
2408, Mock
2408, Turtle
2408, at
2408, last,
2408, with
2408, a
2408, deep
2408, sigh,
2408, 'I
2408, was
2408, a
2408, real
2409, Turtle.'
2410, 
2411, These
2411, words
2411, were
2411, followed
2411, by
2411, a
2411, very
2411, long
2411, silence,
2411, broken
2411, only
2411, by
2411, an
2412, occasional
2412, exclamation
2412, of
2412, 'Hjckrrh!'
2412, from
2412, the
2412, Gryphon,
2412, and
2412, the
2412, constant
2413, heavy
2413, sobbing
2413, of
2413, the
2413, Mock
2413, Turtle.
2413, Alice
2413, was
2413, very
2413, nearly
2413, getting
2413, up
2413, and
2414, saying,
2414, 'Thank
2414, you,
2414, sir,
2414, for
2414, your
2414, interesting
2414, story,'
2414, but
2414, she
2414, could
2415, not
2415, help
2415, thinking
2415, there
2415, MUST
2415, be
2415, more
2415, to
2415, come,
2415, so
2415, she
2415, sat
2415, still
2415, and
2415, said
2416, nothing.
2417, 
2418, 'When
2418, we
2418, were
2418, little,'
2418, the
2418, Mock
2418, Turtle
2418, went
2418, on
2418, at
2418, last,
2418, more
2418, calmly,
2419, though
2419, still
2419, sobbing
2419, a
2419, little
2419, now
2419, and
2419, then,
2419, 'we
2419, went
2419, to
2419, school
2419, in
2419, the
2420, sea.
2420, The
2420, master
2420, was
2420, an
2420, old
2420, Turtle--we
2420, used
2420, to
2420, call
2420, him
2420, Tortoise--'
2421, 
2422, 'Why
2422, did
2422, you
2422, call
2422, him
2422, Tortoise,
2422, if
2422, he
2422, wasn't
2422, one?'
2422, Alice
2422, asked.
2423, 
2424, 'We
2424, called
2424, him
2424, Tortoise
2424, because
2424, he
2424, taught
2424, us,'
2424, said
2424, the
2424, Mock
2424, Turtle
2425, angrily:
2425, 'really
2425, you
2425, are
2425, very
2425, dull!'
2426, 
2427, 'You
2427, ought
2427, to
2427, be
2427, ashamed
2427, of
2427, yourself
2427, for
2427, asking
2427, such
2427, a
2427, simple
2427, question,'
2428, added
2428, the
2428, Gryphon;
2428, and
2428, then
2428, they
2428, both
2428, sat
2428, silent
2428, and
2428, looked
2428, at
2428, poor
2429, Alice,
2429, who
2429, felt
2429, ready
2429, to
2429, sink
2429, into
2429, the
2429, earth.
2429, At
2429, last
2429, the
2429, Gryphon
2429, said
2430, to
2430, the
2430, Mock
2430, Turtle,
2430, 'Drive
2430, on,
2430, old
2430, fellow!
2430, Don't
2430, be
2430, all
2430, day
2430, about
2430, it!'
2431, and
2431, he
2431, went
2431, on
2431, in
2431, these
2431, words:
2432, 
2433, 'Yes,
2433, we
2433, went
2433, to
2433, school
2433, in
2433, the
2433, sea,
2433, though
2433, you
2433, mayn't
2433, believe
2433, it--'
2434, 
2435, 'I
2435, never
2435, said
2435, I
2435, didn't!'
2435, interrupted
2435, Alice.
2436, 
2437, 'You
2437, did,'
2437, said
2437, the
2437, Mock
2437, Turtle.
2438, 
2439, 'Hold
2439, your
2439, tongue!'
2439, added
2439, the
2439, Gryphon,
2439, before
2439, Alice
2439, could
2439, speak
2439, again.
2440, The
2440, Mock
2440, Turtle
2440, went
2440, on.
2441, 
2442, 'We
2442, had
2442, the
2442, best
2442, of
2442, educations--in
2442, fact,
2442, we
2442, went
2442, to
2442, school
2442, every
2442, day--'
2443, 
2444, 'I'VE
2444, been
2444, to
2444, a
2444, day-school,
2444, too,'
2444, said
2444, Alice;
2444, 'you
2444, needn't
2444, be
2444, so
2444, proud
2445, as
2445, all
2445, that.'
2446, 
2447, 'With
2447, extras?'
2447, asked
2447, the
2447, Mock
2447, Turtle
2447, a
2447, little
2447, anxiously.
2448, 
2449, 'Yes,'
2449, said
2449, Alice,
2449, 'we
2449, learned
2449, French
2449, and
2449, music.'
2450, 
2451, 'And
2451, washing?'
2451, said
2451, the
2451, Mock
2451, Turtle.
2452, 
2453, 'Certainly
2453, not!'
2453, said
2453, Alice
2453, indignantly.
2454, 
2455, 'Ah!
2455, then
2455, yours
2455, wasn't
2455, a
2455, really
2455, good
2455, school,'
2455, said
2455, the
2455, Mock
2455, Turtle
2455, in
2456, a
2456, tone
2456, of
2456, great
2456, relief.
2456, 'Now
2456, at
2456, OURS
2456, they
2456, had
2456, at
2456, the
2456, end
2456, of
2456, the
2456, bill,
2457, "French,
2457, music,
2457, AND
2457, WASHING--extra."'
2458, 
2459, 'You
2459, couldn't
2459, have
2459, wanted
2459, it
2459, much,'
2459, said
2459, Alice;
2459, 'living
2459, at
2459, the
2459, bottom
2459, of
2460, the
2460, sea.'
2461, 
2462, 'I
2462, couldn't
2462, afford
2462, to
2462, learn
2462, it.'
2462, said
2462, the
2462, Mock
2462, Turtle
2462, with
2462, a
2462, sigh.
2462, 'I
2463, only
2463, took
2463, the
2463, regular
2463, course.'
2464, 
2465, 'What
2465, was
2465, that?'
2465, inquired
2465, Alice.
2466, 
2467, 'Reeling
2467, and
2467, Writhing,
2467, of
2467, course,
2467, to
2467, begin
2467, with,'
2467, the
2467, Mock
2467, Turtle
2468, replied;
2468, 'and
2468, then
2468, the
2468, different
2468, branches
2468, of
2468, Arithmetic--Ambition,
2469, Distraction,
2469, Uglification,
2469, and
2469, Derision.'
2470, 
2471, 'I
2471, never
2471, heard
2471, of
2471, "Uglification,"'
2471, Alice
2471, ventured
2471, to
2471, say.
2471, 'What
2471, is
2471, it?'
2472, 
2473, The
2473, Gryphon
2473, lifted
2473, up
2473, both
2473, its
2473, paws
2473, in
2473, surprise.
2473, 'What!
2473, Never
2473, heard
2473, of
2474, uglifying!'
2474, it
2474, exclaimed.
2474, 'You
2474, know
2474, what
2474, to
2474, beautify
2474, is,
2474, I
2474, suppose?'
2475, 
2476, 'Yes,'
2476, said
2476, Alice
2476, doubtfully:
2476, 'it
2476, means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
2477, 
2478, 'Well,
2478, then,'
2478, the
2478, Gryphon
2478, went
2478, on,
2478, 'if
2478, you
2478, don't
2478, know
2478, what
2478, to
2478, uglify
2478, is,
2479, you
2479, ARE
2479, a
2479, simpleton.'
2480, 
2481, Alice
2481, did
2481, not
2481, feel
2481, encouraged
2481, to
2481, ask
2481, any
2481, more
2481, questions
2481, about
2481, it,
2481, so
2481, she
2482, turned
2482, to
2482, the
2482, Mock
2482, Turtle,
2482, and
2482, said
2482, 'What
2482, else
2482, had
2482, you
2482, to
2482, learn?'
2483, 
2484, 'Well,
2484, there
2484, was
2484, Mystery,'
2484, the
2484, Mock
2484, Turtle
2484, replied,
2484, counting
2484, off
2485, the
2485, subjects
2485, on
2485, his
2485, flappers,
2485, '--Mystery,
2485, ancient
2485, and
2485, modern,
2485, with
2486, Seaography:
2486, then
2486, Drawling--the
2486, Drawling-master
2486, was
2486, an
2486, old
2486, conger-eel,
2487, that
2487, used
2487, to
2487, come
2487, once
2487, a
2487, week:
2487, HE
2487, taught
2487, us
2487, Drawling,
2487, Stretching,
2487, and
2488, Fainting
2488, in
2488, Coils.'
2489, 
2490, 'What
2490, was
2490, THAT
2490, like?'
2490, said
2490, Alice.
2491, 
2492, 'Well,
2492, I
2492, can't
2492, show
2492, it
2492, you
2492, myself,'
2492, the
2492, Mock
2492, Turtle
2492, said:
2492, 'I'm
2492, too
2493, stiff.
2493, And
2493, the
2493, Gryphon
2493, never
2493, learnt
2493, it.'
2494, 
2495, 'Hadn't
2495, time,'
2495, said
2495, the
2495, Gryphon:
2495, 'I
2495, went
2495, to
2495, the
2495, Classics
2495, master,
2495, though.
2496, He
2496, was
2496, an
2496, old
2496, crab,
2496, HE
2496, was.'
2497, 
2498, 'I
2498, never
2498, went
2498, to
2498, him,'
2498, the
2498, Mock
2498, Turtle
2498, said
2498, with
2498, a
2498, sigh:
2498, 'he
2498, taught
2499, Laughing
2499, and
2499, Grief,
2499, they
2499, used
2499, to
2499, say.'
2500, 
2501, 'So
2501, he
2501, did,
2501, so
2501, he
2501, did,'
2501, said
2501, the
2501, Gryphon,
2501, sighing
2501, in
2501, his
2501, turn;
2501, and
2501, both
2502, creatures
2502, hid
2502, their
2502, faces
2502, in
2502, their
2502, paws.
2503, 
2504, 'And
2504, how
2504, many
2504, hours
2504, a
2504, day
2504, did
2504, you
2504, do
2504, lessons?'
2504, said
2504, Alice,
2504, in
2504, a
2504, hurry
2504, to
2505, change
2505, the
2505, subject.
2506, 
2507, 'Ten
2507, hours
2507, the
2507, first
2507, day,'
2507, said
2507, the
2507, Mock
2507, Turtle:
2507, 'nine
2507, the
2507, next,
2507, and
2507, so
2508, on.'
2509, 
2510, 'What
2510, a
2510, curious
2510, plan!'
2510, exclaimed
2510, Alice.
2511, 
2512, 'That's
2512, the
2512, reason
2512, they're
2512, called
2512, lessons,'
2512, the
2512, Gryphon
2512, remarked:
2513, 'because
2513, they
2513, lessen
2513, from
2513, day
2513, to
2513, day.'
2514, 
2515, This
2515, was
2515, quite
2515, a
2515, new
2515, idea
2515, to
2515, Alice,
2515, and
2515, she
2515, thought
2515, it
2515, over
2515, a
2515, little
2516, before
2516, she
2516, made
2516, her
2516, next
2516, remark.
2516, 'Then
2516, the
2516, eleventh
2516, day
2516, must
2516, have
2516, been
2516, a
2517, holiday?'
2518, 
2519, 'Of
2519, course
2519, it
2519, was,'
2519, said
2519, the
2519, Mock
2519, Turtle.
2520, 
2521, 'And
2521, how
2521, did
2521, you
2521, manage
2521, on
2521, the
2521, twelfth?'
2521, Alice
2521, went
2521, on
2521, eagerly.
2522, 
2523, 'That's
2523, enough
2523, about
2523, lessons,'
2523, the
2523, Gryphon
2523, interrupted
2523, in
2523, a
2523, very
2523, decided
2524, tone:
2524, 'tell
2524, her
2524, something
2524, about
2524, the
2524, games
2524, now.'

2526, 
2527, 
2528, 
2529, CHAPTER
2529, X.
2529, The
2529, Lobster
2529, Quadrille
2530, 
2531, The
2531, Mock
2531, Turtle
2531, sighed
2531, deeply,
2531, and
2531, drew
2531, the
2531, back
2531, of
2531, one
2531, flapper
2531, across
2532, his
2532, eyes.
2532, He
2532, looked
2532, at
2532, Alice,
2532, and
2532, tried
2532, to
2532, speak,
2532, but
2532, for
2532, a
2532, minute
2532, or
2533, two
2533, sobs
2533, choked
2533, his
2533, voice.
2533, 'Same
2533, as
2533, if
2533, he
2533, had
2533, a
2533, bone
2533, in
2533, his
2533, throat,'
2534, said
2534, the
2534, Gryphon:
2534, and
2534, it
2534, set
2534, to
2534, work
2534, shaking
2534, him
2534, and
2534, punching
2534, him
2534, in
2535, the
2535, back.
2535, At
2535, last
2535, the
2535, Mock
2535, Turtle
2535, recovered
2535, his
2535, voice,
2535, and,
2535, with
2535, tears
2536, running
2536, down
2536, his
2536, cheeks,
2536, he
2536, went
2536, on
2536, again:--
2537, 
2538, 'You
2538, may
2538, not
2538, have
2538, lived
2538, much
2538, under
2538, the
2538, sea--'
2538, ('I
2538, haven't,'
2538, said
2539, Alice)--'and
2539, perhaps
2539, you
2539, were
2539, never
2539, even
2539, introduced
2539, to
2539, a
2539, lobster--'
2540, (Alice
2540, began
2540, to
2540, say
2540, 'I
2540, once
2540, tasted--'
2540, but
2540, checked
2540, herself
2540, hastily,
2540, and
2541, said
2541, 'No,
2541, never')
2541, '--so
2541, you
2541, can
2541, have
2541, no
2541, idea
2541, what
2541, a
2541, delightful
2541, thing
2541, a
2542, Lobster
2542, Quadrille
2542, is!'
2543, 
2544, 'No,
2544, indeed,'
2544, said
2544, Alice.
2544, 'What
2544, sort
2544, of
2544, a
2544, dance
2544, is
2544, it?'
2545, 
2546, 'Why,'
2546, said
2546, the
2546, Gryphon,
2546, 'you
2546, first
2546, form
2546, into
2546, a
2546, line
2546, along
2546, the
2547, sea-shore--'
2548, 
2549, 'Two
2549, lines!'
2549, cried
2549, the
2549, Mock
2549, Turtle.
2549, 'Seals,
2549, turtles,
2549, salmon,
2549, and
2549, so
2549, on;
2550, then,
2550, when
2550, you've
2550, cleared
2550, all
2550, the
2550, jelly-fish
2550, out
2550, of
2550, the
2550, way--'
2551, 
2552, 'THAT
2552, generally
2552, takes
2552, some
2552, time,'
2552, interrupted
2552, the
2552, Gryphon.
2553, 
2554, '--you
2554, advance
2554, twice--'
2555, 
2556, 'Each
2556, with
2556, a
2556, lobster
2556, as
2556, a
2556, partner!'
2556, cried
2556, the
2556, Gryphon.
2557, 
2558, 'Of
2558, course,'
2558, the
2558, Mock
2558, Turtle
2558, said:
2558, 'advance
2558, twice,
2558, set
2558, to
2558, partners--'
2559, 
2560, '--change
2560, lobsters,
2560, and
2560, retire
2560, in
2560, same
2560, order,'
2560, continued
2560, the
2560, Gryphon.
2561, 
2562, 'Then,
2562, you
2562, know,'
2562, the
2562, Mock
2562, Turtle
2562, went
2562, on,
2562, 'you
2562, throw
2562, the--'
2563, 
2564, 'The
2564, lobsters!'
2564, shouted
2564, the
2564, Gryphon,
2564, with
2564, a
2564, bound
2564, into
2564, the
2564, air.
2565, 
2566, '--as
2566, far
2566, out
2566, to
2566, sea
2566, as
2566, you
2566, can--'
2567, 
2568, 'Swim
2568, after
2568, them!'
2568, screamed
2568, the
2568, Gryphon.
2569, 
2570, 'Turn
2570, a
2570, somersault
2570, in
2570, the
2570, sea!'
2570, cried
2570, the
2570, Mock
2570, Turtle,
2570, capering
2570, wildly
2571, about.
2572, 
2573, 'Change
2573, lobsters
2573, again!'
2573, yelled
2573, the
2573, Gryphon
2573, at
2573, the
2573, top
2573, of
2573, its
2573, voice.
2574, 
2575, 'Back
2575, to
2575, land
2575, again,
2575, and
2575, that's
2575, all
2575, the
2575, first
2575, figure,'
2575, said
2575, the
2575, Mock
2576, Turtle,
2576, suddenly
2576, dropping
2576, his
2576, voice;
2576, and
2576, the
2576, two
2576, creatures,
2576, who
2576, had
2576, been
2577, jumping
2577, about
2577, like
2577, mad
2577, things
2577, all
2577, this
2577, time,
2577, sat
2577, down
2577, again
2577, very
2577, sadly
2578, and
2578, quietly,
2578, and
2578, looked
2578, at
2578, Alice.
2579, 
2580, 'It
2580, must
2580, be
2580, a
2580, very
2580, pretty
2580, dance,'
2580, said
2580, Alice
2580, timidly.
2581, 
2582, 'Would
2582, you
2582, like
2582, to
2582, see
2582, a
2582, little
2582, of
2582, it?'
2582, said
2582, the
2582, Mock
2582, Turtle.
2583, 
2584, 'Very
2584, much
2584, indeed,'
2584, said
2584, Alice.
2585, 
2586, 'Come,
2586, let's
2586, try
2586, the
2586, first
2586, figure!'
2586, said
2586, the
2586, Mock
2586, Turtle
2586, to
2586, the
2586, Gryphon.
2587, 'We
2587, can
2587, do
2587, without
2587, lobsters,
2587, you
2587, know.
2587, Which
2587, shall
2587, sing?'
2588, 
2589, 'Oh,
2589, YOU
2589, sing,'
2589, said
2589, the
2589, Gryphon.
2589, 'I've
2589, forgotten
2589, the
2589, words.'
2590, 
2591, So
2591, they
2591, began
2591, solemnly
2591, dancing
2591, round
2591, and
2591, round
2591, Alice,
2591, every
2591, now
2591, and
2592, then
2592, treading
2592, on
2592, her
2592, toes
2592, when
2592, they
2592, passed
2592, too
2592, close,
2592, and
2592, waving
2592, their
2593, forepaws
2593, to
2593, mark
2593, the
2593, time,
2593, while
2593, the
2593, Mock
2593, Turtle
2593, sang
2593, this,
2593, very
2593, slowly
2594, and
2594, sadly:--
2595, 
2596, '"Will
2596, you
2596, walk
2596, a
2596, little
2596, faster?"
2596, said
2596, a
2596, whiting
2596, to
2596, a
2596, snail.
2597, "There's
2597, a
2597, porpoise
2597, close
2597, behind
2597, us,
2597, and
2597, he's
2597, treading
2597, on
2597, my
2597, tail.
2598, 
2599, See
2599, how
2599, eagerly
2599, the
2599, lobsters
2599, and
2599, the
2599, turtles
2599, all
2599, advance!
2600, They
2600, are
2600, waiting
2600, on
2600, the
2600, shingle--will
2600, you
2600, come
2600, and
2600, join
2600, the
2600, dance?
2601, 
2602, Will
2602, you,
2602, won't
2602, you,
2602, will
2602, you,
2602, won't
2602, you,
2602, will
2602, you
2602, join
2602, the
2602, dance?
2603, Will
2603, you,
2603, won't
2603, you,
2603, will
2603, you,
2603, won't
2603, you,
2603, won't
2603, you
2603, join
2603, the
2603, dance?
2604, 
2605, "You
2605, can
2605, really
2605, have
2605, no
2605, notion
2605, how
2605, delightful
2605, it
2605, will
2605, be
2606, When
2606, they
2606, take
2606, us
2606, up
2606, and
2606, throw
2606, us,
2606, with
2606, the
2606, lobsters,
2606, out
2606, to
2606, sea!"
2607, But
2607, the
2607, snail
2607, replied
2607, "Too
2607, far,
2607, too
2607, far!"
2607, and
2607, gave
2607, a
2607, look
2607, askance--
2608, Said
2608, he
2608, thanked
2608, the
2608, whiting
2608, kindly,
2608, but
2608, he
2608, would
2608, not
2608, join
2608, the
2608, dance.
2609, 
2610, Would
2610, not,
2610, could
2610, not,
2610, would
2610, not,
2610, could
2610, not,
2610, would
2610, not
2610, join
2610, the
2610, dance.
2611, Would
2611, not,
2611, could
2611, not,
2611, would
2611, not,
2611, could
2611, not,
2611, could
2611, not
2611, join
2611, the
2611, dance.
2612, 
2613, '"What
2613, matters
2613, it
2613, how
2613, far
2613, we
2613, go?"
2613, his
2613, scaly
2613, friend
2613, replied.
2614, "There
2614, is
2614, another
2614, shore,
2614, you
2614, know,
2614, upon
2614, the
2614, other
2614, side.
2615, The
2615, further
2615, off
2615, from
2615, England
2615, the
2615, nearer
2615, is
2615, to
2615, France--
2616, Then
2616, turn
2616, not
2616, pale,
2616, beloved
2616, snail,
2616, but
2616, come
2616, and
2616, join
2616, the
2616, dance.
2617, 
2618, Will
2618, you,
2618, won't
2618, you,
2618, will
2618, you,
2618, won't
2618, you,
2618, will
2618, you
2618, join
2618, the
2618, dance?
2619, Will
2619, you,
2619, won't
2619, you,
2619, will
2619, you,
2619, won't
2619, you,
2619, won't
2619, you
2619, join
2619, the
2619, dance?"'
2620, 
2621, 'Thank
2621, you,
2621, it's
2621, a
2621, very
2621, interesting
2621, dance
2621, to
2621, watch,'
2621, said
2621, Alice,
2621, feeling
2622, very
2622, glad
2622, that
2622, it
2622, was
2622, over
2622, at
2622, last:
2622, 'and
2622, I
2622, do
2622, so
2622, like
2622, that
2622, curious
2622, song
2623, about
2623, the
2623, whiting!'
2624, 
2625, 'Oh,
2625, as
2625, to
2625, the
2625, whiting,'
2625, said
2625, the
2625, Mock
2625, Turtle,
2625, 'they--you've
2625, seen
2625, them,
2626, of
2626, course?'
2627, 
2628, 'Yes,'
2628, said
2628, Alice,
2628, 'I've
2628, often
2628, seen
2628, them
2628, at
2628, dinn--'
2628, she
2628, checked
2628, herself
2629, hastily.
2630, 
2631, 'I
2631, don't
2631, know
2631, where
2631, Dinn
2631, may
2631, be,'
2631, said
2631, the
2631, Mock
2631, Turtle,
2631, 'but
2631, if
2631, you've
2632, seen
2632, them
2632, so
2632, often,
2632, of
2632, course
2632, you
2632, know
2632, what
2632, they're
2632, like.'
2633, 
2634, 'I
2634, believe
2634, so,'
2634, Alice
2634, replied
2634, thoughtfully.
2634, 'They
2634, have
2634, their
2634, tails
2634, in
2635, their
2635, mouths--and
2635, they're
2635, all
2635, over
2635, crumbs.'
2636, 
2637, 'You're
2637, wrong
2637, about
2637, the
2637, crumbs,'
2637, said
2637, the
2637, Mock
2637, Turtle:
2637, 'crumbs
2637, would
2637, all
2638, wash
2638, off
2638, in
2638, the
2638, sea.
2638, But
2638, they
2638, HAVE
2638, their
2638, tails
2638, in
2638, their
2638, mouths;
2638, and
2638, the
2639, reason
2639, is--'
2639, here
2639, the
2639, Mock
2639, Turtle
2639, yawned
2639, and
2639, shut
2639, his
2639, eyes.--'Tell
2639, her
2640, about
2640, the
2640, reason
2640, and
2640, all
2640, that,'
2640, he
2640, said
2640, to
2640, the
2640, Gryphon.
2641, 
2642, 'The
2642, reason
2642, is,'
2642, said
2642, the
2642, Gryphon,
2642, 'that
2642, they
2642, WOULD
2642, go
2642, with
2642, the
2642, lobsters
2643, to
2643, the
2643, dance.
2643, So
2643, they
2643, got
2643, thrown
2643, out
2643, to
2643, sea.
2643, So
2643, they
2643, had
2643, to
2643, fall
2643, a
2643, long
2644, way.
2644, So
2644, they
2644, got
2644, their
2644, tails
2644, fast
2644, in
2644, their
2644, mouths.
2644, So
2644, they
2644, couldn't
2644, get
2645, them
2645, out
2645, again.
2645, That's
2645, all.'
2646, 
2647, 'Thank
2647, you,'
2647, said
2647, Alice,
2647, 'it's
2647, very
2647, interesting.
2647, I
2647, never
2647, knew
2647, so
2647, much
2648, about
2648, a
2648, whiting
2648, before.'
2649, 
2650, 'I
2650, can
2650, tell
2650, you
2650, more
2650, than
2650, that,
2650, if
2650, you
2650, like,'
2650, said
2650, the
2650, Gryphon.
2650, 'Do
2650, you
2651, know
2651, why
2651, it's
2651, called
2651, a
2651, whiting?'
2652, 
2653, 'I
2653, never
2653, thought
2653, about
2653, it,'
2653, said
2653, Alice.
2653, 'Why?'
2654, 
2655, 'IT
2655, DOES
2655, THE
2655, BOOTS
2655, AND
2655, SHOES.'
2655, the
2655, Gryphon
2655, replied
2655, very
2655, solemnly.
2656, 
2657, Alice
2657, was
2657, thoroughly
2657, puzzled.
2657, 'Does
2657, the
2657, boots
2657, and
2657, shoes!'
2657, she
2657, repeated
2658, in
2658, a
2658, wondering
2658, tone.
2659, 
2660, 'Why,
2660, what
2660, are
2660, YOUR
2660, shoes
2660, done
2660, with?'
2660, said
2660, the
2660, Gryphon.
2660, 'I
2660, mean,
2660, what
2661, makes
2661, them
2661, so
2661, shiny?'
2662, 
2663, Alice
2663, looked
2663, down
2663, at
2663, them,
2663, and
2663, considered
2663, a
2663, little
2663, before
2663, she
2663, gave
2663, her
2664, answer.
2664, 'They're
2664, done
2664, with
2664, blacking,
2664, I
2664, believe.'
2665, 
2666, 'Boots
2666, and
2666, shoes
2666, under
2666, the
2666, sea,'
2666, the
2666, Gryphon
2666, went
2666, on
2666, in
2666, a
2666, deep
2666, voice,
2667, 'are
2667, done
2667, with
2667, a
2667, whiting.
2667, Now
2667, you
2667, know.'
2668, 
2669, 'And
2669, what
2669, are
2669, they
2669, made
2669, of?'
2669, Alice
2669, asked
2669, in
2669, a
2669, tone
2669, of
2669, great
2669, curiosity.
2670, 
2671, 'Soles
2671, and
2671, eels,
2671, of
2671, course,'
2671, the
2671, Gryphon
2671, replied
2671, rather
2671, impatiently:
2672, 'any
2672, shrimp
2672, could
2672, have
2672, told
2672, you
2672, that.'
2673, 
2674, 'If
2674, I'd
2674, been
2674, the
2674, whiting,'
2674, said
2674, Alice,
2674, whose
2674, thoughts
2674, were
2674, still
2674, running
2675, on
2675, the
2675, song,
2675, 'I'd
2675, have
2675, said
2675, to
2675, the
2675, porpoise,
2675, "Keep
2675, back,
2675, please:
2675, we
2676, don't
2676, want
2676, YOU
2676, with
2676, us!"'
2677, 
2678, 'They
2678, were
2678, obliged
2678, to
2678, have
2678, him
2678, with
2678, them,'
2678, the
2678, Mock
2678, Turtle
2678, said:
2678, 'no
2679, wise
2679, fish
2679, would
2679, go
2679, anywhere
2679, without
2679, a
2679, porpoise.'
2680, 
2681, 'Wouldn't
2681, it
2681, really?'
2681, said
2681, Alice
2681, in
2681, a
2681, tone
2681, of
2681, great
2681, surprise.
2682, 
2683, 'Of
2683, course
2683, not,'
2683, said
2683, the
2683, Mock
2683, Turtle:
2683, 'why,
2683, if
2683, a
2683, fish
2683, came
2683, to
2683, ME,
2683, and
2684, told
2684, me
2684, he
2684, was
2684, going
2684, a
2684, journey,
2684, I
2684, should
2684, say
2684, "With
2684, what
2684, porpoise?"'
2685, 
2686, 'Don't
2686, you
2686, mean
2686, "purpose"?'
2686, said
2686, Alice.
2687, 
2688, 'I
2688, mean
2688, what
2688, I
2688, say,'
2688, the
2688, Mock
2688, Turtle
2688, replied
2688, in
2688, an
2688, offended
2688, tone.
2688, And
2689, the
2689, Gryphon
2689, added
2689, 'Come,
2689, let's
2689, hear
2689, some
2689, of
2689, YOUR
2689, adventures.'
2690, 
2691, 'I
2691, could
2691, tell
2691, you
2691, my
2691, adventures--beginning
2691, from
2691, this
2691, morning,'
2691, said
2692, Alice
2692, a
2692, little
2692, timidly:
2692, 'but
2692, it's
2692, no
2692, use
2692, going
2692, back
2692, to
2692, yesterday,
2693, because
2693, I
2693, was
2693, a
2693, different
2693, person
2693, then.'
2694, 
2695, 'Explain
2695, all
2695, that,'
2695, said
2695, the
2695, Mock
2695, Turtle.
2696, 
2697, 'No,
2697, no!
2697, The
2697, adventures
2697, first,'
2697, said
2697, the
2697, Gryphon
2697, in
2697, an
2697, impatient
2697, tone:
2698, 'explanations
2698, take
2698, such
2698, a
2698, dreadful
2698, time.'
2699, 
2700, So
2700, Alice
2700, began
2700, telling
2700, them
2700, her
2700, adventures
2700, from
2700, the
2700, time
2700, when
2700, she
2700, first
2701, saw
2701, the
2701, White
2701, Rabbit.
2701, She
2701, was
2701, a
2701, little
2701, nervous
2701, about
2701, it
2701, just
2701, at
2701, first,
2702, the
2702, two
2702, creatures
2702, got
2702, so
2702, close
2702, to
2702, her,
2702, one
2702, on
2702, each
2702, side,
2702, and
2702, opened
2703, their
2703, eyes
2703, and
2703, mouths
2703, so
2703, VERY
2703, wide,
2703, but
2703, she
2703, gained
2703, courage
2703, as
2703, she
2703, went
2704, on.
2704, Her
2704, listeners
2704, were
2704, perfectly
2704, quiet
2704, till
2704, she
2704, got
2704, to
2704, the
2704, part
2704, about
2705, her
2705, repeating
2705, 'YOU
2705, ARE
2705, OLD,
2705, FATHER
2705, WILLIAM,'
2705, to
2705, the
2705, Caterpillar,
2705, and
2705, the
2706, words
2706, all
2706, coming
2706, different,
2706, and
2706, then
2706, the
2706, Mock
2706, Turtle
2706, drew
2706, a
2706, long
2706, breath,
2707, and
2707, said
2707, 'That's
2707, very
2707, curious.'
2708, 
2709, 'It's
2709, all
2709, about
2709, as
2709, curious
2709, as
2709, it
2709, can
2709, be,'
2709, said
2709, the
2709, Gryphon.
2710, 
2711, 'It
2711, all
2711, came
2711, different!'
2711, the
2711, Mock
2711, Turtle
2711, repeated
2711, thoughtfully.
2711, 'I
2712, should
2712, like
2712, to
2712, hear
2712, her
2712, try
2712, and
2712, repeat
2712, something
2712, now.
2712, Tell
2712, her
2712, to
2713, begin.'
2713, He
2713, looked
2713, at
2713, the
2713, Gryphon
2713, as
2713, if
2713, he
2713, thought
2713, it
2713, had
2713, some
2713, kind
2713, of
2714, authority
2714, over
2714, Alice.
2715, 
2716, 'Stand
2716, up
2716, and
2716, repeat
2716, "'TIS
2716, THE
2716, VOICE
2716, OF
2716, THE
2716, SLUGGARD,"'
2716, said
2716, the
2717, Gryphon.
2718, 
2719, 'How
2719, the
2719, creatures
2719, order
2719, one
2719, about,
2719, and
2719, make
2719, one
2719, repeat
2719, lessons!'
2720, thought
2720, Alice;
2720, 'I
2720, might
2720, as
2720, well
2720, be
2720, at
2720, school
2720, at
2720, once.'
2720, However,
2720, she
2721, got
2721, up,
2721, and
2721, began
2721, to
2721, repeat
2721, it,
2721, but
2721, her
2721, head
2721, was
2721, so
2721, full
2721, of
2721, the
2721, Lobster
2722, Quadrille,
2722, that
2722, she
2722, hardly
2722, knew
2722, what
2722, she
2722, was
2722, saying,
2722, and
2722, the
2722, words
2722, came
2723, very
2723, queer
2723, indeed:--
2724, 
2725, ''Tis
2725, the
2725, voice
2725, of
2725, the
2725, Lobster;
2725, I
2725, heard
2725, him
2725, declare,
2726, "You
2726, have
2726, baked
2726, me
2726, too
2726, brown,
2726, I
2726, must
2726, sugar
2726, my
2726, hair."
2727, As
2727, a
2727, duck
2727, with
2727, its
2727, eyelids,
2727, so
2727, he
2727, with
2727, his
2727, nose
2728, Trims
2728, his
2728, belt
2728, and
2728, his
2728, buttons,
2728, and
2728, turns
2728, out
2728, his
2728, toes.'
2729, 
2730, [later
2730, editions
2730, continued
2730, as
2730, follows
2731, When
2731, the
2731, sands
2731, are
2731, all
2731, dry,
2731, he
2731, is
2731, gay
2731, as
2731, a
2731, lark,
2732, And
2732, will
2732, talk
2732, in
2732, contemptuous
2732, tones
2732, of
2732, the
2732, Shark,
2733, But,
2733, when
2733, the
2733, tide
2733, rises
2733, and
2733, sharks
2733, are
2733, around,
2734, His
2734, voice
2734, has
2734, a
2734, timid
2734, and
2734, tremulous
2734, sound.]
2735, 
2736, 'That's
2736, different
2736, from
2736, what
2736, I
2736, used
2736, to
2736, say
2736, when
2736, I
2736, was
2736, a
2736, child,'
2736, said
2736, the
2737, Gryphon.
2738, 
2739, 'Well,
2739, I
2739, never
2739, heard
2739, it
2739, before,'
2739, said
2739, the
2739, Mock
2739, Turtle;
2739, 'but
2739, it
2739, sounds
2740, uncommon
2740, nonsense.'
2741, 
2742, Alice
2742, said
2742, nothing;
2742, she
2742, had
2742, sat
2742, down
2742, with
2742, her
2742, face
2742, in
2742, her
2742, hands,
2743, wondering
2743, if
2743, anything
2743, would
2743, EVER
2743, happen
2743, in
2743, a
2743, natural
2743, way
2743, again.
2744, 
2745, 'I
2745, should
2745, like
2745, to
2745, have
2745, it
2745, explained,'
2745, said
2745, the
2745, Mock
2745, Turtle.
2746, 
2747, 'She
2747, can't
2747, explain
2747, it,'
2747, said
2747, the
2747, Gryphon
2747, hastily.
2747, 'Go
2747, on
2747, with
2747, the
2747, next
2748, verse.'
2749, 
2750, 'But
2750, about
2750, his
2750, toes?'
2750, the
2750, Mock
2750, Turtle
2750, persisted.
2750, 'How
2750, COULD
2750, he
2750, turn
2750, them
2751, out
2751, with
2751, his
2751, nose,
2751, you
2751, know?'
2752, 
2753, 'It's
2753, the
2753, first
2753, position
2753, in
2753, dancing.'
2753, Alice
2753, said;
2753, but
2753, was
2753, dreadfully
2754, puzzled
2754, by
2754, the
2754, whole
2754, thing,
2754, and
2754, longed
2754, to
2754, change
2754, the
2754, subject.
2755, 
2756, 'Go
2756, on
2756, with
2756, the
2756, next
2756, verse,'
2756, the
2756, Gryphon
2756, repeated
2756, impatiently:
2756, 'it
2757, begins
2757, "I
2757, passed
2757, by
2757, his
2757, garden."'
2758, 
2759, Alice
2759, did
2759, not
2759, dare
2759, to
2759, disobey,
2759, though
2759, she
2759, felt
2759, sure
2759, it
2759, would
2759, all
2759, come
2760, wrong,
2760, and
2760, she
2760, went
2760, on
2760, in
2760, a
2760, trembling
2760, voice:--
2761, 
2762, 'I
2762, passed
2762, by
2762, his
2762, garden,
2762, and
2762, marked,
2762, with
2762, one

2763, How
2763, the
2763, Owl
2763, and
2763, the
2763, Panther
2763, were
2763, sharing
2763, a
2763, pie--'
2764, 
2765, [later
2765, editions
2765, continued
2765, as
2765, follows
2766, The
2766, Panther
2766, took
2766, pie-crust,
2766, and
2766, gravy,
2766, and
2766, meat,
2767, While
2767, the
2767, Owl
2767, had
2767, the
2767, dish
2767, as
2767, its
2767, share
2767, of
2767, the
2767, treat.
2768, When
2768, the
2768, pie
2768, was
2768, all
2768, finished,
2768, the
2768, Owl,
2768, as
2768, a
2768, boon,
2769, Was
2769, kindly
2769, permitted
2769, to
2769, pocket
2769, the
2769, spoon:
2770, While
2770, the
2770, Panther
2770, received
2770, knife
2770, and
2770, fork
2770, with
2770, a
2770, growl,
2771, And
2771, concluded
2771, the
2771, banquet--]
2772, 
2773, 'What
2773, IS
2773, the
2773, use
2773, of
2773, repeating
2773, all
2773, that
2773, stuff,'
2773, the
2773, Mock
2773, Turtle
2774, interrupted,
2774, 'if
2774, you
2774, don't
2774, explain
2774, it
2774, as
2774, you
2774, go
2774, on?
2774, It's
2774, by
2774, far
2774, the
2774, most
2775, confusing
2775, thing
2775, I
2775, ever
2775, heard!'
2776, 
2777, 'Yes,
2777, I
2777, think
2777, you'd
2777, better
2777, leave
2777, off,'
2777, said
2777, the
2777, Gryphon:
2777, and
2777, Alice
2777, was
2778, only
2778, too
2778, glad
2778, to
2778, do
2778, so.
2779, 
2780, 'Shall
2780, we
2780, try
2780, another
2780, figure
2780, of
2780, the
2780, Lobster
2780, Quadrille?'
2780, the
2780, Gryphon
2780, went
2781, on.
2781, 'Or
2781, would
2781, you
2781, like
2781, the
2781, Mock
2781, Turtle
2781, to
2781, sing
2781, you
2781, a
2781, song?'
2782, 
2783, 'Oh,
2783, a
2783, song,
2783, please,
2783, if
2783, the
2783, Mock
2783, Turtle
2783, would
2783, be
2783, so
2783, kind,'
2783, Alice
2784, replied,
2784, so
2784, eagerly
2784, that
2784, the
2784, Gryphon
2784, said,
2784, in
2784, a
2784, rather
2784, offended
2784, tone,
2785, 'Hm!
2785, No
2785, accounting
2785, for
2785, tastes!
2785, Sing
2785, her
2785, "Turtle
2785, Soup,"
2785, will
2785, you,
2785, old
2786, fellow?'
2787, 
2788, The
2788, Mock
2788, Turtle
2788, sighed
2788, deeply,
2788, and
2788, began,
2788, in
2788, a
2788, voice
2788, sometimes
2788, choked
2789, with
2789, sobs,
2789, to
2789, sing
2789, this:--
2790, 
2791, 'Beautiful
2791, Soup,
2791, so
2791, rich
2791, and

2800, 
2801, 'Beautiful

2801, cares
2801, for

2802, any
2802, other
2802, dish?
2803, Who
2803, would
2803, not
2803, give
2803, all
2803, else

2810, 
2811, 'Chorus
2811, again!'
2811, cried
2811, the
2811, Gryphon,
2811, and
2811, the
2811, Mock
2811, Turtle
2811, had
2811, just
2811, begun
2812, to
2812, repeat
2812, it,
2812, when
2812, a
2812, cry
2812, of
2812, 'The
2812, trial's
2812, beginning!'
2812, was
2812, heard
2812, in
2812, the
2813, distance.
2814, 
2815, 'Come
2815, on!'
2815, cried
2815, the
2815, Gryphon,
2815, and,
2815, taking
2815, Alice
2815, by
2815, the
2815, hand,
2815, it
2815, hurried
2816, off,
2816, without
2816, waiting
2816, for
2816, the
2816, end
2816, of
2816, the
2816, song.
2817, 
2818, 'What
2818, trial
2818, is
2818, it?'
2818, Alice
2818, panted
2818, as
2818, she
2818, ran;
2818, but
2818, the
2818, Gryphon
2818, only
2819, answered
2819, 'Come
2819, on!'
2819, and
2819, ran
2819, the
2819, faster,
2819, while
2819, more
2819, and
2819, more
2819, faintly
2820, came,
2820, carried
2820, on
2820, the
2820, breeze
2820, that
2820, followed
2820, them,
2820, the
2820, melancholy
2820, words:--
2821, 
2822, 'Soo--oop
2822, of
2822, the
2822, e--e--evening,
2823, Beautiful,
2823, beautiful

2828, CHAPTER
2828, XI.
2828, Who
2828, Stole
2828, the
2828, Tarts?
2829, 
2830, The
2830, King
2830, and
2830, Queen
2830, of
2830, Hearts
2830, were
2830, seated
2830, on
2830, their
2830, throne
2830, when
2830, they
2831, arrived,
2831, with
2831, a
2831, great
2831, crowd
2831, assembled
2831, about
2831, them--all
2831, sorts
2831, of
2831, little
2832, birds
2832, and
2832, beasts,
2832, as
2832, well
2832, as
2832, the
2832, whole
2832, pack
2832, of
2832, cards:
2832, the
2832, Knave
2832, was
2833, standing
2833, before
2833, them,
2833, in
2833, chains,
2833, with
2833, a
2833, soldier
2833, on
2833, each
2833, side
2833, to
2833, guard
2834, him;
2834, and
2834, near
2834, the
2834, King
2834, was
2834, the
2834, White
2834, Rabbit,
2834, with
2834, a
2834, trumpet
2834, in
2834, one
2834, hand,
2835, and
2835, a
2835, scroll
2835, of
2835, parchment
2835, in
2835, the
2835, other.
2835, In
2835, the
2835, very
2835, middle
2835, of
2835, the
2835, court
2836, was
2836, a
2836, table,
2836, with
2836, a
2836, large
2836, dish
2836, of
2836, tarts
2836, upon
2836, it:
2836, they
2836, looked
2836, so
2836, good,
2837, that
2837, it
2837, made
2837, Alice
2837, quite
2837, hungry
2837, to
2837, look
2837, at
2837, them--'I
2837, wish
2837, they'd
2837, get
2837, the
2838, trial
2838, done,'
2838, she
2838, thought,
2838, 'and
2838, hand
2838, round
2838, the
2838, refreshments!'
2838, But
2838, there
2839, seemed
2839, to
2839, be
2839, no
2839, chance
2839, of
2839, this,
2839, so
2839, she
2839, began
2839, looking
2839, at
2839, everything
2839, about
2840, her,
2840, to
2840, pass
2840, away
2840, the
2840, time.
2841, 
2842, Alice
2842, had
2842, never
2842, been
2842, in
2842, a
2842, court
2842, of
2842, justice
2842, before,
2842, but
2842, she
2842, had
2842, read
2843, about
2843, them
2843, in
2843, books,
2843, and
2843, she
2843, was
2843, quite
2843, pleased
2843, to
2843, find
2843, that
2843, she
2843, knew
2844, the
2844, name
2844, of
2844, nearly
2844, everything
2844, there.
2844, 'That's
2844, the
2844, judge,'
2844, she
2844, said
2844, to
2845, herself,
2845, 'because
2845, of
2845, his
2845, great
2845, wig.'
2846, 
2847, The
2847, judge,
2847, by
2847, the
2847, way,
2847, was
2847, the
2847, King;
2847, and
2847, as
2847, he
2847, wore
2847, his
2847, crown
2847, over
2847, the
2848, wig,
2848, (look
2848, at
2848, the
2848, frontispiece
2848, if
2848, you
2848, want
2848, to
2848, see
2848, how
2848, he
2848, did
2848, it,)
2848, he
2848, did
2849, not
2849, look
2849, at
2849, all
2849, comfortable,
2849, and
2849, it
2849, was
2849, certainly
2849, not
2849, becoming.
2850, 
2851, 'And
2851, that's
2851, the
2851, jury-box,'
2851, thought
2851, Alice,
2851, 'and
2851, those
2851, twelve
2851, creatures,'
2852, (she
2852, was
2852, obliged
2852, to
2852, say
2852, 'creatures,'
2852, you
2852, see,
2852, because
2852, some
2852, of
2852, them
2852, were
2853, animals,
2853, and
2853, some
2853, were
2853, birds,)
2853, 'I
2853, suppose
2853, they
2853, are
2853, the
2853, jurors.'
2853, She
2853, said
2854, this
2854, last
2854, word
2854, two
2854, or
2854, three
2854, times
2854, over
2854, to
2854, herself,
2854, being
2854, rather
2854, proud
2854, of
2855, it:
2855, for
2855, she
2855, thought,
2855, and
2855, rightly
2855, too,
2855, that
2855, very
2855, few
2855, little
2855, girls
2855, of
2855, her
2856, age
2856, knew
2856, the
2856, meaning
2856, of
2856, it
2856, at
2856, all.
2856, However,
2856, 'jury-men'
2856, would
2856, have
2856, done
2857, just
2857, as
2857, well.
2858, 
2859, The
2859, twelve
2859, jurors
2859, were
2859, all
2859, writing
2859, very
2859, busily
2859, on
2859, slates.
2859, 'What
2859, are
2859, they
2860, doing?'
2860, Alice
2860, whispered
2860, to
2860, the
2860, Gryphon.
2860, 'They
2860, can't
2860, have
2860, anything
2860, to
2860, put
2861, down
2861, yet,
2861, before
2861, the
2861, trial's
2861, begun.'
2862, 
2863, 'They're
2863, putting
2863, down
2863, their
2863, names,'
2863, the
2863, Gryphon
2863, whispered
2863, in
2863, reply,
2863, 'for
2864, fear
2864, they
2864, should
2864, forget
2864, them
2864, before
2864, the
2864, end
2864, of
2864, the
2864, trial.'
2865, 
2866, 'Stupid
2866, things!'
2866, Alice
2866, began
2866, in
2866, a
2866, loud,
2866, indignant
2866, voice,
2866, but
2866, she
2866, stopped
2867, hastily,
2867, for
2867, the
2867, White
2867, Rabbit
2867, cried
2867, out,
2867, 'Silence
2867, in
2867, the
2867, court!'
2867, and
2867, the
2868, King
2868, put
2868, on
2868, his
2868, spectacles
2868, and
2868, looked
2868, anxiously
2868, round,
2868, to
2868, make
2868, out
2868, who
2869, was
2869, talking.
2870, 
2871, Alice
2871, could
2871, see,
2871, as
2871, well
2871, as
2871, if
2871, she
2871, were
2871, looking
2871, over
2871, their
2871, shoulders,
2872, that
2872, all
2872, the
2872, jurors
2872, were
2872, writing
2872, down
2872, 'stupid
2872, things!'
2872, on
2872, their
2872, slates,
2873, and
2873, she
2873, could
2873, even
2873, make
2873, out
2873, that
2873, one
2873, of
2873, them
2873, didn't
2873, know
2873, how
2873, to
2873, spell
2874, 'stupid,'
2874, and
2874, that
2874, he
2874, had
2874, to
2874, ask
2874, his
2874, neighbour
2874, to
2874, tell
2874, him.
2874, 'A
2874, nice
2875, muddle
2875, their
2875, slates'll
2875, be
2875, in
2875, before
2875, the
2875, trial's
2875, over!'
2875, thought
2875, Alice.
2876, 
2877, One
2877, of
2877, the
2877, jurors
2877, had
2877, a
2877, pencil
2877, that
2877, squeaked.
2877, This
2877, of
2877, course,
2877, Alice
2878, could
2878, not
2878, stand,
2878, and
2878, she
2878, went
2878, round
2878, the
2878, court
2878, and
2878, got
2878, behind
2878, him,
2878, and
2879, very
2879, soon
2879, found
2879, an
2879, opportunity
2879, of
2879, taking
2879, it
2879, away.
2879, She
2879, did
2879, it
2879, so
2879, quickly
2880, that
2880, the
2880, poor
2880, little
2880, juror
2880, (it
2880, was
2880, Bill,
2880, the
2880, Lizard)
2880, could
2880, not
2880, make
2880, out
2881, at
2881, all
2881, what
2881, had
2881, become
2881, of
2881, it;
2881, so,
2881, after
2881, hunting
2881, all
2881, about
2881, for
2881, it,
2881, he
2881, was
2882, obliged
2882, to
2882, write
2882, with
2882, one
2882, finger
2882, for
2882, the
2882, rest
2882, of
2882, the
2882, day;
2882, and
2882, this
2882, was
2883, of
2883, very
2883, little
2883, use,
2883, as
2883, it
2883, left
2883, no
2883, mark
2883, on
2883, the
2883, slate.
2884, 
2885, 'Herald,
2885, read
2885, the
2885, accusation!'
2885, said
2885, the
2885, King.
2886, 
2887, On
2887, this
2887, the
2887, White
2887, Rabbit
2887, blew
2887, three
2887, blasts
2887, on
2887, the
2887, trumpet,
2887, and
2887, then
2888, unrolled
2888, the
2888, parchment
2888, scroll,
2888, and
2888, read
2888, as
2888, follows:--
2889, 
2890, 'The
2890, Queen
2890, of
2890, Hearts,
2890, she
2890, made
2890, some
2890, tarts,
2891, All
2891, on
2891, a
2891, summer
2891, day:
2892, The
2892, Knave
2892, of
2892, Hearts,
2892, he
2892, stole
2892, those
2892, tarts,
2893, And
2893, took
2893, them
2893, quite
2893, away!'
2894, 
2895, 'Consider
2895, your
2895, verdict,'
2895, the
2895, King
2895, said
2895, to
2895, the
2895, jury.
2896, 
2897, 'Not
2897, yet,
2897, not
2897, yet!'
2897, the
2897, Rabbit
2897, hastily
2897, interrupted.
2897, 'There's
2897, a
2897, great
2898, deal
2898, to
2898, come
2898, before
2898, that!'
2899, 
2900, 'Call
2900, the
2900, first
2900, witness,'
2900, said
2900, the
2900, King;
2900, and
2900, the
2900, White
2900, Rabbit
2900, blew
2900, three
2901, blasts
2901, on
2901, the
2901, trumpet,
2901, and
2901, called
2901, out,
2901, 'First
2901, witness!'
2902, 
2903, The
2903, first
2903, witness
2903, was
2903, the
2903, Hatter.
2903, He
2903, came
2903, in
2903, with
2903, a
2903, teacup
2903, in
2903, one
2904, hand
2904, and
2904, a
2904, piece
2904, of
2904, bread-and-butter
2904, in
2904, the
2904, other.
2904, 'I
2904, beg
2904, pardon,
2904, your
2905, Majesty,'
2905, he
2905, began,
2905, 'for
2905, bringing
2905, these
2905, in:
2905, but
2905, I
2905, hadn't
2905, quite
2905, finished
2906, my
2906, tea
2906, when
2906, I
2906, was
2906, sent
2906, for.'
2907, 
2908, 'You
2908, ought
2908, to
2908, have
2908, finished,'
2908, said
2908, the
2908, King.
2908, 'When
2908, did
2908, you
2908, begin?'
2909, 
2910, The
2910, Hatter
2910, looked
2910, at
2910, the
2910, March
2910, Hare,
2910, who
2910, had
2910, followed
2910, him
2910, into
2910, the
2911, court,
2911, arm-in-arm
2911, with
2911, the
2911, Dormouse.
2911, 'Fourteenth
2911, of
2911, March,
2911, I
2911, think
2911, it
2912, was,'
2912, he
2912, said.
2913, 
2914, 'Fifteenth,'
2914, said
2914, the
2914, March
2914, Hare.
2915, 
2916, 'Sixteenth,'
2916, added
2916, the
2916, Dormouse.
2917, 
2918, 'Write
2918, that
2918, down,'
2918, the
2918, King
2918, said
2918, to
2918, the
2918, jury,
2918, and
2918, the
2918, jury
2918, eagerly
2919, wrote
2919, down
2919, all
2919, three
2919, dates
2919, on
2919, their
2919, slates,
2919, and
2919, then
2919, added
2919, them
2919, up,
2919, and
2920, reduced
2920, the
2920, answer
2920, to
2920, shillings
2920, and
2920, pence.
2921, 
2922, 'Take
2922, off
2922, your
2922, hat,'
2922, the
2922, King
2922, said
2922, to
2922, the
2922, Hatter.
2923, 
2924, 'It
2924, isn't
2924, mine,'
2924, said
2924, the
2924, Hatter.
2925, 
2926, 'Stolen!'
2926, the
2926, King
2926, exclaimed,
2926, turning
2926, to
2926, the
2926, jury,
2926, who
2926, instantly
2926, made
2926, a
2927, memorandum
2927, of
2927, the
2927, fact.
2928, 
2929, 'I
2929, keep
2929, them
2929, to
2929, sell,'
2929, the
2929, Hatter
2929, added
2929, as
2929, an
2929, explanation;
2929, 'I've
2929, none
2929, of
2930, my
2930, own.
2930, I'm
2930, a
2930, hatter.'
2931, 
2932, Here
2932, the
2932, Queen
2932, put
2932, on
2932, her
2932, spectacles,
2932, and
2932, began
2932, staring
2932, at
2932, the
2932, Hatter,
2933, who
2933, turned
2933, pale
2933, and
2933, fidgeted.
2934, 
2935, 'Give
2935, your
2935, evidence,'
2935, said
2935, the
2935, King;
2935, 'and
2935, don't
2935, be
2935, nervous,
2935, or
2935, I'll
2935, have
2936, you
2936, executed
2936, on
2936, the
2936, spot.'
2937, 
2938, This
2938, did
2938, not
2938, seem
2938, to
2938, encourage
2938, the
2938, witness
2938, at
2938, all:
2938, he
2938, kept
2938, shifting
2939, from
2939, one
2939, foot
2939, to
2939, the
2939, other,
2939, looking
2939, uneasily
2939, at
2939, the
2939, Queen,
2939, and
2939, in
2940, his
2940, confusion
2940, he
2940, bit
2940, a
2940, large
2940, piece
2940, out
2940, of
2940, his
2940, teacup
2940, instead
2940, of
2940, the
2941, bread-and-butter.
2942, 
2943, Just
2943, at
2943, this
2943, moment
2943, Alice
2943, felt
2943, a
2943, very
2943, curious
2943, sensation,
2943, which
2943, puzzled
2944, her
2944, a
2944, good
2944, deal
2944, until
2944, she
2944, made
2944, out
2944, what
2944, it
2944, was:
2944, she
2944, was
2944, beginning
2944, to
2945, grow
2945, larger
2945, again,
2945, and
2945, she
2945, thought
2945, at
2945, first
2945, she
2945, would
2945, get
2945, up
2945, and
2945, leave
2946, the
2946, court;
2946, but
2946, on
2946, second
2946, thoughts
2946, she
2946, decided
2946, to
2946, remain
2946, where
2946, she
2946, was
2946, as
2947, long
2947, as
2947, there
2947, was
2947, room
2947, for
2947, her.
2948, 
2949, 'I
2949, wish
2949, you
2949, wouldn't
2949, squeeze
2949, so.'
2949, said
2949, the
2949, Dormouse,
2949, who
2949, was
2949, sitting
2950, next
2950, to
2950, her.
2950, 'I
2950, can
2950, hardly
2950, breathe.'
2951, 
2952, 'I
2952, can't
2952, help
2952, it,'
2952, said
2952, Alice
2952, very
2952, meekly:
2952, 'I'm
2952, growing.'
2953, 
2954, 'You've
2954, no
2954, right
2954, to
2954, grow
2954, here,'
2954, said
2954, the
2954, Dormouse.
2955, 
2956, 'Don't
2956, talk
2956, nonsense,'
2956, said
2956, Alice
2956, more
2956, boldly:
2956, 'you
2956, know
2956, you're
2956, growing
2957, too.'
2958, 
2959, 'Yes,
2959, but
2959, I
2959, grow
2959, at
2959, a
2959, reasonable
2959, pace,'
2959, said
2959, the
2959, Dormouse:
2959, 'not
2959, in
2959, that
2960, ridiculous
2960, fashion.'
2960, And
2960, he
2960, got
2960, up
2960, very
2960, sulkily
2960, and
2960, crossed
2960, over
2960, to
2960, the
2961, other
2961, side
2961, of
2961, the
2961, court.
2962, 
2963, All
2963, this
2963, time
2963, the
2963, Queen
2963, had
2963, never
2963, left
2963, off
2963, staring
2963, at
2963, the
2963, Hatter,
2963, and,
2964, just
2964, as
2964, the
2964, Dormouse
2964, crossed
2964, the
2964, court,
2964, she
2964, said
2964, to
2964, one
2964, of
2964, the
2964, officers
2965, of
2965, the
2965, court,
2965, 'Bring
2965, me
2965, the
2965, list
2965, of
2965, the
2965, singers
2965, in
2965, the
2965, last
2965, concert!'
2965, on
2966, which
2966, the
2966, wretched
2966, Hatter
2966, trembled
2966, so,
2966, that
2966, he
2966, shook
2966, both
2966, his
2966, shoes
2966, off.
2967, 
2968, 'Give
2968, your
2968, evidence,'
2968, the
2968, King
2968, repeated
2968, angrily,
2968, 'or
2968, I'll
2968, have
2968, you
2969, executed,
2969, whether
2969, you're
2969, nervous
2969, or
2969, not.'
2970, 
2971, 'I'm
2971, a
2971, poor
2971, man,
2971, your
2971, Majesty,'
2971, the
2971, Hatter
2971, began,
2971, in
2971, a
2971, trembling
2971, voice,
2972, '--and
2972, I
2972, hadn't
2972, begun
2972, my
2972, tea--not
2972, above
2972, a
2972, week
2972, or
2972, so--and
2972, what
2972, with
2972, the
2973, bread-and-butter
2973, getting
2973, so
2973, thin--and
2973, the
2973, twinkling
2973, of
2973, the
2973, tea--'
2974, 
2975, 'The
2975, twinkling
2975, of
2975, the
2975, what?'
2975, said
2975, the
2975, King.
2976, 
2977, 'It
2977, began
2977, with
2977, the
2977, tea,'
2977, the
2977, Hatter
2977, replied.
2978, 
2979, 'Of
2979, course
2979, twinkling
2979, begins
2979, with
2979, a
2979, T!'
2979, said
2979, the
2979, King
2979, sharply.
2979, 'Do
2979, you
2980, take
2980, me
2980, for
2980, a
2980, dunce?
2980, Go
2980, on!'
2981, 
2982, 'I'm
2982, a
2982, poor
2982, man,'
2982, the
2982, Hatter
2982, went
2982, on,
2982, 'and
2982, most
2982, things
2982, twinkled
2982, after
2983, that--only
2983, the
2983, March
2983, Hare
2983, said--'
2984, 
2985, 'I
2985, didn't!'
2985, the
2985, March
2985, Hare
2985, interrupted
2985, in
2985, a
2985, great
2985, hurry.
2986, 
2987, 'You
2987, did!'
2987, said
2987, the
2987, Hatter.
2988, 
2989, 'I
2989, deny
2989, it!'
2989, said
2989, the
2989, March
2989, Hare.
2990, 
2991, 'He
2991, denies
2991, it,'
2991, said
2991, the
2991, King:
2991, 'leave
2991, out
2991, that
2991, part.'
2992, 
2993, 'Well,
2993, at
2993, any
2993, rate,
2993, the
2993, Dormouse
2993, said--'
2993, the
2993, Hatter
2993, went
2993, on,
2993, looking
2994, anxiously
2994, round
2994, to
2994, see
2994, if
2994, he
2994, would
2994, deny
2994, it
2994, too:
2994, but
2994, the
2994, Dormouse
2994, denied
2995, nothing,
2995, being
2995, fast
2995, asleep.
2996, 
2997, 'After
2997, that,'
2997, continued
2997, the
2997, Hatter,
2997, 'I
2997, cut
2997, some
2997, more
2997, bread-and-butter--'
2998, 
2999, 'But
2999, what
2999, did
2999, the
2999, Dormouse
2999, say?'
2999, one
2999, of
2999, the
2999, jury
2999, asked.
3000, 
3001, 'That
3001, I
3001, can't
3001, remember,'
3001, said
3001, the
3001, Hatter.
3002, 
3003, 'You
3003, MUST
3003, remember,'
3003, remarked
3003, the
3003, King,
3003, 'or
3003, I'll
3003, have
3003, you
3003, executed.'
3004, 
3005, The
3005, miserable
3005, Hatter
3005, dropped
3005, his
3005, teacup
3005, and
3005, bread-and-butter,
3005, and
3005, went
3006, down
3006, on
3006, one
3006, knee.
3006, 'I'm
3006, a
3006, poor
3006, man,
3006, your
3006, Majesty,'
3006, he
3006, began.
3007, 
3008, 'You're
3008, a
3008, very
3008, poor
3008, speaker,'
3008, said
3008, the
3008, King.
3009, 
3010, Here
3010, one
3010, of
3010, the
3010, guinea-pigs
3010, cheered,
3010, and
3010, was
3010, immediately
3010, suppressed
3010, by
3011, the
3011, officers
3011, of
3011, the
3011, court.
3011, (As
3011, that
3011, is
3011, rather
3011, a
3011, hard
3011, word,
3011, I
3011, will
3011, just
3012, explain
3012, to
3012, you
3012, how
3012, it
3012, was
3012, done.
3012, They
3012, had
3012, a
3012, large
3012, canvas
3012, bag,
3012, which
3012, tied
3013, up
3013, at
3013, the
3013, mouth
3013, with
3013, strings:
3013, into
3013, this
3013, they
3013, slipped
3013, the
3013, guinea-pig,
3014, head
3014, first,
3014, and
3014, then
3014, sat
3014, upon
3014, it.)
3015, 
3016, 'I'm
3016, glad
3016, I've
3016, seen
3016, that
3016, done,'
3016, thought
3016, Alice.
3016, 'I've
3016, so
3016, often
3016, read
3017, in
3017, the
3017, newspapers,
3017, at
3017, the
3017, end
3017, of
3017, trials,
3017, "There
3017, was
3017, some
3017, attempts
3018, at
3018, applause,
3018, which
3018, was
3018, immediately
3018, suppressed
3018, by
3018, the
3018, officers
3018, of
3018, the
3019, court,"
3019, and
3019, I
3019, never
3019, understood
3019, what
3019, it
3019, meant
3019, till
3019, now.'
3020, 
3021, 'If
3021, that's
3021, all
3021, you
3021, know
3021, about
3021, it,
3021, you
3021, may
3021, stand
3021, down,'
3021, continued
3021, the
3022, King.
3023, 
3024, 'I
3024, can't
3024, go
3024, no
3024, lower,'
3024, said
3024, the
3024, Hatter:
3024, 'I'm
3024, on
3024, the
3024, floor,
3024, as
3024, it
3024, is.'
3025, 
3026, 'Then
3026, you
3026, may
3026, SIT
3026, down,'
3026, the
3026, King
3026, replied.
3027, 
3028, Here
3028, the
3028, other
3028, guinea-pig
3028, cheered,
3028, and
3028, was
3028, suppressed.
3029, 
3030, 'Come,
3030, that
3030, finished
3030, the
3030, guinea-pigs!'
3030, thought
3030, Alice.
3030, 'Now
3030, we
3030, shall
3030, get
3031, on
3031, better.'
3032, 
3033, 'I'd
3033, rather
3033, finish
3033, my
3033, tea,'
3033, said
3033, the
3033, Hatter,
3033, with
3033, an
3033, anxious
3033, look
3033, at
3033, the
3034, Queen,
3034, who
3034, was
3034, reading
3034, the
3034, list
3034, of
3034, singers.
3035, 
3036, 'You
3036, may
3036, go,'
3036, said
3036, the
3036, King,
3036, and
3036, the
3036, Hatter
3036, hurriedly
3036, left
3036, the
3036, court,
3037, without
3037, even
3037, waiting
3037, to
3037, put
3037, his
3037, shoes
3037, on.
3038, 
3039, '--and
3039, just
3039, take
3039, his
3039, head
3039, off
3039, outside,'
3039, the
3039, Queen
3039, added
3039, to
3039, one
3039, of
3039, the
3040, officers:
3040, but
3040, the
3040, Hatter
3040, was
3040, out
3040, of
3040, sight
3040, before
3040, the
3040, officer
3040, could
3040, get
3041, to
3041, the
3041, door.
3042, 
3043, 'Call
3043, the
3043, next
3043, witness!'
3043, said
3043, the
3043, King.
3044, 
3045, The
3045, next
3045, witness
3045, was
3045, the
3045, Duchess's
3045, cook.
3045, She
3045, carried
3045, the
3045, pepper-box
3045, in
3046, her
3046, hand,
3046, and
3046, Alice
3046, guessed
3046, who
3046, it
3046, was,
3046, even
3046, before
3046, she
3046, got
3046, into
3046, the
3047, court,
3047, by
3047, the
3047, way
3047, the
3047, people
3047, near
3047, the
3047, door
3047, began
3047, sneezing
3047, all
3047, at
3047, once.
3048, 
3049, 'Give
3049, your
3049, evidence,'
3049, said
3049, the
3049, King.
3050, 
3051, 'Shan't,'
3051, said
3051, the
3051, cook.
3052, 
3053, The
3053, King
3053, looked
3053, anxiously
3053, at
3053, the
3053, White
3053, Rabbit,
3053, who
3053, said
3053, in
3053, a
3053, low
3053, voice,
3054, 'Your
3054, Majesty
3054, must
3054, cross-examine
3054, THIS
3054, witness.'
3055, 
3056, 'Well,
3056, if
3056, I
3056, must,
3056, I
3056, must,'
3056, the
3056, King
3056, said,
3056, with
3056, a
3056, melancholy
3056, air,
3056, and,
3057, after
3057, folding
3057, his
3057, arms
3057, and
3057, frowning
3057, at
3057, the
3057, cook
3057, till
3057, his
3057, eyes
3057, were
3058, nearly
3058, out
3058, of
3058, sight,
3058, he
3058, said
3058, in
3058, a
3058, deep
3058, voice,
3058, 'What
3058, are
3058, tarts
3058, made
3058, of?'
3059, 
3060, 'Pepper,
3060, mostly,'
3060, said
3060, the
3060, cook.
3061, 
3062, 'Treacle,'
3062, said
3062, a
3062, sleepy
3062, voice
3062, behind
3062, her.
3063, 
3064, 'Collar
3064, that
3064, Dormouse,'
3064, the
3064, Queen
3064, shrieked
3064, out.
3064, 'Behead
3064, that
3064, Dormouse!
3065, Turn
3065, that
3065, Dormouse
3065, out
3065, of
3065, court!
3065, Suppress
3065, him!
3065, Pinch
3065, him!
3065, Off
3065, with
3065, his
3066, whiskers!'
3067, 
3068, For
3068, some
3068, minutes
3068, the
3068, whole
3068, court
3068, was
3068, in
3068, confusion,
3068, getting
3068, the
3068, Dormouse
3069, turned
3069, out,
3069, and,
3069, by
3069, the
3069, time
3069, they
3069, had
3069, settled
3069, down
3069, again,
3069, the
3069, cook
3069, had
3070, disappeared.
3071, 
3072, 'Never
3072, mind!'
3072, said
3072, the
3072, King,
3072, with
3072, an
3072, air
3072, of
3072, great
3072, relief.
3072, 'Call
3072, the
3072, next
3073, witness.'
3073, And
3073, he
3073, added
3073, in
3073, an
3073, undertone
3073, to
3073, the
3073, Queen,
3073, 'Really,
3073, my
3073, dear,
3074, YOU
3074, must
3074, cross-examine
3074, the
3074, next
3074, witness.
3074, It
3074, quite
3074, makes
3074, my
3074, forehead
3075, ache!'
3076, 
3077, Alice
3077, watched
3077, the
3077, White
3077, Rabbit
3077, as
3077, he
3077, fumbled
3077, over
3077, the
3077, list,
3077, feeling
3077, very
3078, curious
3078, to
3078, see
3078, what
3078, the
3078, next
3078, witness
3078, would
3078, be
3078, like,
3078, '--for
3078, they
3078, haven't
3079, got
3079, much
3079, evidence
3079, YET,'
3079, she
3079, said
3079, to
3079, herself.
3079, Imagine
3079, her
3079, surprise,
3079, when
3080, the
3080, White
3080, Rabbit
3080, read
3080, out,
3080, at
3080, the
3080, top
3080, of
3080, his
3080, shrill
3080, little
3080, voice,
3080, the
3081, name
3081, 'Alice!'
3082, 
3083, 
3084, 
3085, CHAPTER
3085, XII
3086, 
3087, Alice's
3087, Evidence
3088, 
3089, 
3090, 'Here!'
3090, cried
3090, Alice,
3090, quite
3090, forgetting
3090, in
3090, the
3090, flurry
3090, of
3090, the
3090, moment
3090, how
3091, large
3091, she
3091, had
3091, grown
3091, in
3091, the
3091, last
3091, few
3091, minutes,
3091, and
3091, she
3091, jumped
3091, up
3091, in
3091, such
3092, a
3092, hurry
3092, that
3092, she
3092, tipped
3092, over
3092, the
3092, jury-box
3092, with
3092, the
3092, edge
3092, of
3092, her
3092, skirt,
3093, upsetting
3093, all
3093, the
3093, jurymen
3093, on
3093, to
3093, the
3093, heads
3093, of
3093, the
3093, crowd
3093, below,
3093, and
3093, there
3094, they
3094, lay
3094, sprawling
3094, about,
3094, reminding
3094, her
3094, very
3094, much
3094, of
3094, a
3094, globe
3094, of
3094, goldfish
3095, she
3095, had
3095, accidentally
3095, upset
3095, the
3095, week
3095, before.
3096, 
3097, 'Oh,
3097, I
3097, BEG
3097, your
3097, pardon!'
3097, she
3097, exclaimed
3097, in
3097, a
3097, tone
3097, of
3097, great
3097, dismay,
3097, and
3098, began
3098, picking
3098, them
3098, up
3098, again
3098, as
3098, quickly
3098, as
3098, she
3098, could,
3098, for
3098, the
3098, accident
3098, of
3099, the
3099, goldfish
3099, kept
3099, running
3099, in
3099, her
3099, head,
3099, and
3099, she
3099, had
3099, a
3099, vague
3099, sort
3099, of
3099, idea
3100, that
3100, they
3100, must
3100, be
3100, collected
3100, at
3100, once
3100, and
3100, put
3100, back
3100, into
3100, the
3100, jury-box,
3100, or
3101, they
3101, would
3101, die.
3102, 
3103, 'The
3103, trial
3103, cannot
3103, proceed,'
3103, said
3103, the
3103, King
3103, in
3103, a
3103, very
3103, grave
3103, voice,
3103, 'until
3104, all
3104, the
3104, jurymen
3104, are
3104, back
3104, in
3104, their
3104, proper
3104, places--ALL,'
3104, he
3104, repeated
3104, with
3105, great
3105, emphasis,
3105, looking
3105, hard
3105, at
3105, Alice
3105, as
3105, he
3105, said
3105, do.
3106, 
3107, Alice
3107, looked
3107, at
3107, the
3107, jury-box,
3107, and
3107, saw
3107, that,
3107, in
3107, her
3107, haste,
3107, she
3107, had
3107, put
3108, the
3108, Lizard
3108, in
3108, head
3108, downwards,
3108, and
3108, the
3108, poor
3108, little
3108, thing
3108, was
3108, waving
3108, its
3109, tail
3109, about
3109, in
3109, a
3109, melancholy
3109, way,
3109, being
3109, quite
3109, unable
3109, to
3109, move.
3109, She
3109, soon
3109, got
3110, it
3110, out
3110, again,
3110, and
3110, put
3110, it
3110, right;
3110, 'not
3110, that
3110, it
3110, signifies
3110, much,'
3110, she
3110, said
3111, to
3111, herself;
3111, 'I
3111, should
3111, think
3111, it
3111, would
3111, be
3111, QUITE
3111, as
3111, much
3111, use
3111, in
3111, the
3111, trial
3112, one
3112, way
3112, up
3112, as
3112, the
3112, other.'
3113, 
3114, As
3114, soon
3114, as
3114, the
3114, jury
3114, had
3114, a
3114, little
3114, recovered
3114, from
3114, the
3114, shock
3114, of
3114, being
3115, upset,
3115, and
3115, their
3115, slates
3115, and
3115, pencils
3115, had
3115, been
3115, found
3115, and
3115, handed
3115, back
3115, to
3116, them,
3116, they
3116, set
3116, to
3116, work
3116, very
3116, diligently
3116, to
3116, write
3116, out
3116, a
3116, history
3116, of
3116, the
3117, accident,
3117, all
3117, except
3117, the
3117, Lizard,
3117, who
3117, seemed
3117, too
3117, much
3117, overcome
3117, to
3117, do
3118, anything
3118, but
3118, sit
3118, with
3118, its
3118, mouth
3118, open,
3118, gazing
3118, up
3118, into
3118, the
3118, roof
3118, of
3118, the
3119, court.
3120, 
3121, 'What
3121, do
3121, you
3121, know
3121, about
3121, this
3121, business?'
3121, the
3121, King
3121, said
3121, to
3121, Alice.
3122, 
3123, 'Nothing,'
3123, said
3123, Alice.
3124, 
3125, 'Nothing
3125, WHATEVER?'
3125, persisted
3125, the
3125, King.
3126, 
3127, 'Nothing
3127, whatever,'
3127, said
3127, Alice.
3128, 
3129, 'That's
3129, very
3129, important,'
3129, the
3129, King
3129, said,
3129, turning
3129, to
3129, the
3129, jury.
3129, They
3129, were
3130, just
3130, beginning
3130, to
3130, write
3130, this
3130, down
3130, on
3130, their
3130, slates,
3130, when
3130, the
3130, White
3130, Rabbit
3131, interrupted:
3131, 'UNimportant,
3131, your
3131, Majesty
3131, means,
3131, of
3131, course,'
3131, he
3131, said
3131, in
3131, a
3132, very
3132, respectful
3132, tone,
3132, but
3132, frowning
3132, and
3132, making
3132, faces
3132, at
3132, him
3132, as
3132, he
3132, spoke.
3133, 
3134, 'UNimportant,
3134, of
3134, course,
3134, I
3134, meant,'
3134, the
3134, King
3134, hastily
3134, said,
3134, and
3134, went
3134, on
3135, to
3135, himself
3135, in
3135, an
3135, undertone,
3136, 
3137, 'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--'
3137, as
3137, if
3137, he
3137, were
3137, trying
3138, which
3138, word
3138, sounded
3138, best.
3139, 
3140, Some
3140, of
3140, the
3140, jury
3140, wrote
3140, it
3140, down
3140, 'important,'
3140, and
3140, some
3140, 'unimportant.'
3141, Alice
3141, could
3141, see
3141, this,
3141, as
3141, she
3141, was
3141, near
3141, enough
3141, to
3141, look
3141, over
3141, their
3141, slates;
3142, 'but
3142, it
3142, doesn't
3142, matter
3142, a
3142, bit,'
3142, she
3142, thought
3142, to
3142, herself.
3143, 
3144, At
3144, this
3144, moment
3144, the
3144, King,
3144, who
3144, had
3144, been
3144, for
3144, some
3144, time
3144, busily
3144, writing
3144, in
3145, his
3145, note-book,
3145, cackled
3145, out
3145, 'Silence!'
3145, and
3145, read
3145, out
3145, from
3145, his
3145, book,
3145, 'Rule
3146, Forty-two.
3146, ALL
3146, PERSONS
3146, MORE
3146, THAN
3146, A
3146, MILE
3146, HIGH
3146, TO
3146, LEAVE
3146, THE
3146, COURT.'
3147, 
3148, Everybody
3148, looked
3148, at
3148, Alice.
3149, 
3150, 'I'M
3150, not
3150, a
3150, mile
3150, high,'
3150, said
3150, Alice.
3151, 
3152, 'You
3152, are,'
3152, said
3152, the
3152, King.
3153, 
3154, 'Nearly
3154, two
3154, miles
3154, high,'
3154, added
3154, the
3154, Queen.
3155, 
3156, 'Well,
3156, I
3156, shan't
3156, go,
3156, at
3156, any
3156, rate,'
3156, said
3156, Alice:
3156, 'besides,
3156, that's
3156, not
3156, a
3157, regular
3157, rule:
3157, you
3157, invented
3157, it
3157, just
3157, now.'
3158, 
3159, 'It's
3159, the
3159, oldest
3159, rule
3159, in
3159, the
3159, book,'
3159, said
3159, the
3159, King.
3160, 
3161, 'Then
3161, it
3161, ought
3161, to
3161, be
3161, Number
3161, One,'
3161, said
3161, Alice.
3162, 
3163, The
3163, King
3163, turned
3163, pale,
3163, and
3163, shut
3163, his
3163, note-book
3163, hastily.
3163, 'Consider
3163, your
3164, verdict,'
3164, he
3164, said
3164, to
3164, the
3164, jury,
3164, in
3164, a
3164, low,
3164, trembling
3164, voice.
3165, 
3166, 'There's
3166, more
3166, evidence
3166, to
3166, come
3166, yet,
3166, please
3166, your
3166, Majesty,'
3166, said
3166, the
3166, White
3167, Rabbit,
3167, jumping
3167, up
3167, in
3167, a
3167, great
3167, hurry;
3167, 'this
3167, paper
3167, has
3167, just
3167, been
3167, picked
3168, up.'
3169, 
3170, 'What's
3170, in
3170, it?'
3170, said
3170, the
3170, Queen.
3171, 
3172, 'I
3172, haven't
3172, opened
3172, it
3172, yet,'
3172, said
3172, the
3172, White
3172, Rabbit,
3172, 'but
3172, it
3172, seems
3172, to
3172, be
3172, a
3173, letter,
3173, written
3173, by
3173, the
3173, prisoner
3173, to--to
3173, somebody.'
3174, 
3175, 'It
3175, must
3175, have
3175, been
3175, that,'
3175, said
3175, the
3175, King,
3175, 'unless
3175, it
3175, was
3175, written
3175, to
3176, nobody,
3176, which
3176, isn't
3176, usual,
3176, you
3176, know.'
3177, 
3178, 'Who
3178, is
3178, it
3178, directed
3178, to?'
3178, said
3178, one
3178, of
3178, the
3178, jurymen.
3179, 
3180, 'It
3180, isn't
3180, directed
3180, at
3180, all,'
3180, said
3180, the
3180, White
3180, Rabbit;
3180, 'in
3180, fact,
3180, there's
3181, nothing
3181, written
3181, on
3181, the
3181, OUTSIDE.'
3181, He
3181, unfolded
3181, the
3181, paper
3181, as
3181, he
3181, spoke,
3181, and
3182, added
3182, 'It
3182, isn't
3182, a
3182, letter,
3182, after
3182, all:
3182, it's
3182, a
3182, set
3182, of
3182, verses.'
3183, 
3184, 'Are
3184, they
3184, in
3184, the
3184, prisoner's
3184, handwriting?'
3184, asked
3184, another
3184, of
3184, the
3184, jurymen.
3185, 
3186, 'No,
3186, they're
3186, not,'
3186, said
3186, the
3186, White
3186, Rabbit,
3186, 'and
3186, that's
3186, the
3186, queerest
3186, thing
3187, about
3187, it.'
3187, (The
3187, jury
3187, all
3187, looked
3187, puzzled.)
3188, 
3189, 'He
3189, must
3189, have
3189, imitated
3189, somebody
3189, else's
3189, hand,'
3189, said
3189, the
3189, King.
3189, (The
3189, jury
3190, all
3190, brightened
3190, up
3190, again.)
3191, 
3192, 'Please
3192, your
3192, Majesty,'
3192, said
3192, the
3192, Knave,
3192, 'I
3192, didn't
3192, write
3192, it,
3192, and
3192, they
3193, can't
3193, prove
3193, I
3193, did:
3193, there's
3193, no
3193, name
3193, signed
3193, at
3193, the
3193, end.'
3194, 
3195, 'If
3195, you
3195, didn't
3195, sign
3195, it,'
3195, said
3195, the
3195, King,
3195, 'that
3195, only
3195, makes
3195, the
3195, matter
3196, worse.
3196, You
3196, MUST
3196, have
3196, meant
3196, some
3196, mischief,
3196, or
3196, else
3196, you'd
3196, have
3196, signed
3196, your
3197, name
3197, like
3197, an
3197, honest
3197, man.'
3198, 
3199, There
3199, was
3199, a
3199, general
3199, clapping
3199, of
3199, hands
3199, at
3199, this:
3199, it
3199, was
3199, the
3199, first
3199, really
3200, clever
3200, thing
3200, the
3200, King
3200, had
3200, said
3200, that
3200, day.
3201, 
3202, 'That
3202, PROVES
3202, his
3202, guilt,'
3202, said
3202, the
3202, Queen.
3203, 
3204, 'It
3204, proves
3204, nothing
3204, of
3204, the
3204, sort!'
3204, said
3204, Alice.
3204, 'Why,
3204, you
3204, don't
3204, even
3204, know
3205, what
3205, they're
3205, about!'
3206, 
3207, 'Read
3207, them,'
3207, said
3207, the
3207, King.
3208, 
3209, The
3209, White
3209, Rabbit
3209, put
3209, on
3209, his
3209, spectacles.
3209, 'Where
3209, shall
3209, I
3209, begin,
3209, please
3210, your
3210, Majesty?'
3210, he
3210, asked.
3211, 
3212, 'Begin
3212, at
3212, the
3212, beginning,'
3212, the
3212, King
3212, said
3212, gravely,
3212, 'and
3212, go
3212, on
3212, till
3212, you
3213, come
3213, to
3213, the
3213, end:
3213, then
3213, stop.'
3214, 
3215, These
3215, were
3215, the
3215, verses
3215, the
3215, White
3215, Rabbit
3215, read:--
3216, 
3217, 'They
3217, told
3217, me
3217, you
3217, had
3217, been
3217, to
3217, her,
3218, And
3218, mentioned
3218, me
3218, to
3218, him:
3219, She
3219, gave
3219, me
3219, a
3219, good
3219, character,
3220, But
3220, said
3220, I
3220, could
3220, not
3220, swim.
3221, 
3222, He
3222, sent
3222, them
3222, word
3222, I
3222, had
3222, not
3222, gone
3223, (We
3223, know
3223, it
3223, to
3223, be
3223, true):
3224, If
3224, she
3224, should
3224, push
3224, the
3224, matter
3224, on,
3225, What
3225, would
3225, become
3225, of
3225, you?
3226, 
3227, I
3227, gave
3227, her
3227, one,
3227, they
3227, gave
3227, him
3227, two,
3228, You
3228, gave
3228, us
3228, three
3228, or
3228, more;
3229, They
3229, all
3229, returned
3229, from
3229, him
3229, to
3229, you,
3230, Though
3230, they
3230, were
3230, mine
3230, before.
3231, 
3232, If
3232, I
3232, or
3232, she
3232, should
3232, chance
3232, to
3232, be
3233, Involved
3233, in
3233, this
3233, affair,
3234, He
3234, trusts
3234, to
3234, you
3234, to
3234, set
3234, them
3234, free,
3235, Exactly
3235, as
3235, we
3235, were.
3236, 
3237, My
3237, notion
3237, was
3237, that
3237, you
3237, had
3237, been
3238, (Before
3238, she
3238, had
3238, this
3238, fit)
3239, An
3239, obstacle
3239, that
3239, came
3239, between
3240, Him,
3240, and
3240, ourselves,
3240, and
3240, it.
3241, 
3242, Don't
3242, let
3242, him
3242, know
3242, she
3242, liked
3242, them
3242, best,
3243, For
3243, this
3243, must
3243, ever
3243, be
3244, A
3244, secret,
3244, kept
3244, from
3244, all
3244, the
3244, rest,
3245, Between
3245, yourself
3245, and
3245, me.'
3246, 
3247, 'That's
3247, the
3247, most
3247, important
3247, piece
3247, of
3247, evidence
3247, we've
3247, heard
3247, yet,'
3247, said
3247, the
3248, King,
3248, rubbing
3248, his
3248, hands;
3248, 'so
3248, now
3248, let
3248, the
3248, jury--'
3249, 
3250, 'If
3250, any
3250, one
3250, of
3250, them
3250, can
3250, explain
3250, it,'
3250, said
3250, Alice,
3250, (she
3250, had
3250, grown
3250, so
3250, large
3251, in
3251, the
3251, last
3251, few
3251, minutes
3251, that
3251, she
3251, wasn't
3251, a
3251, bit
3251, afraid
3251, of
3251, interrupting
3252, him,)
3252, 'I'll
3252, give
3252, him
3252, sixpence.
3252, _I_
3252, don't
3252, believe
3252, there's
3252, an
3252, atom
3252, of
3253, meaning
3253, in
3253, it.'
3254, 
3255, The
3255, jury
3255, all
3255, wrote
3255, down
3255, on
3255, their
3255, slates,
3255, 'SHE
3255, doesn't
3255, believe
3255, there's
3255, an
3256, atom
3256, of
3256, meaning
3256, in
3256, it,'
3256, but
3256, none
3256, of
3256, them
3256, attempted
3256, to
3256, explain
3256, the
3256, paper.
3257, 
3258, 'If
3258, there's
3258, no
3258, meaning
3258, in
3258, it,'
3258, said
3258, the
3258, King,
3258, 'that
3258, saves
3258, a
3258, world
3258, of
3259, trouble,
3259, you
3259, know,
3259, as
3259, we
3259, needn't
3259, try
3259, to
3259, find
3259, any.
3259, And
3259, yet
3259, I
3259, don't
3259, know,'
3260, he
3260, went
3260, on,
3260, spreading
3260, out
3260, the
3260, verses
3260, on
3260, his
3260, knee,
3260, and
3260, looking
3260, at
3260, them
3261, with
3261, one
3261, eye;
3261, 'I
3261, seem
3261, to
3261, see
3261, some
3261, meaning
3261, in
3261, them,
3261, after
3261, all.
3261, "--SAID
3262, I
3262, COULD
3262, NOT
3262, SWIM--"
3262, you
3262, can't
3262, swim,
3262, can
3262, you?'
3262, he
3262, added,
3262, turning
3262, to
3262, the
3263, Knave.
3264, 
3265, The
3265, Knave
3265, shook
3265, his
3265, head
3265, sadly.
3265, 'Do
3265, I
3265, look
3265, like
3265, it?'
3265, he
3265, said.
3265, (Which
3265, he
3266, certainly
3266, did
3266, NOT,
3266, being
3266, made
3266, entirely
3266, of
3266, cardboard.)
3267, 
3268, 'All
3268, right,
3268, so
3268, far,'
3268, said
3268, the
3268, King,
3268, and
3268, he
3268, went
3268, on
3268, muttering
3268, over
3269, the
3269, verses
3269, to
3269, himself:
3269, '"WE
3269, KNOW
3269, IT
3269, TO
3269, BE
3269, TRUE--"
3269, that's
3269, the
3269, jury,
3269, of
3270, course--"I
3270, GAVE
3270, HER
3270, ONE,
3270, THEY
3270, GAVE
3270, HIM
3270, TWO--"
3270, why,
3270, that
3270, must
3270, be
3270, what
3270, he
3271, did
3271, with
3271, the
3271, tarts,
3271, you
3271, know--'
3272, 
3273, 'But,
3273, it
3273, goes
3273, on
3273, "THEY
3273, ALL
3273, RETURNED
3273, FROM
3273, HIM
3273, TO
3273, YOU,"'
3273, said
3273, Alice.
3274, 
3275, 'Why,
3275, there
3275, they
3275, are!'
3275, said
3275, the
3275, King
3275, triumphantly,
3275, pointing
3275, to
3275, the
3275, tarts
3276, on
3276, the
3276, table.
3276, 'Nothing
3276, can
3276, be
3276, clearer
3276, than
3276, THAT.
3276, Then
3276, again--"BEFORE
3276, SHE
3277, HAD
3277, THIS
3277, FIT--"
3277, you
3277, never
3277, had
3277, fits,
3277, my
3277, dear,
3277, I
3277, think?'
3277, he
3277, said
3277, to
3277, the
3278, Queen.
3279, 
3280, 'Never!'
3280, said
3280, the
3280, Queen
3280, furiously,
3280, throwing
3280, an
3280, inkstand
3280, at
3280, the
3280, Lizard
3281, as
3281, she
3281, spoke.
3281, (The
3281, unfortunate
3281, little
3281, Bill
3281, had
3281, left
3281, off
3281, writing
3281, on
3281, his
3282, slate
3282, with
3282, one
3282, finger,
3282, as
3282, he
3282, found
3282, it
3282, made
3282, no
3282, mark;
3282, but
3282, he
3282, now
3282, hastily
3283, began
3283, again,
3283, using
3283, the
3283, ink,
3283, that
3283, was
3283, trickling
3283, down
3283, his
3283, face,
3283, as
3283, long
3283, as
3284, it
3284, lasted.)
3285, 
3286, 'Then
3286, the
3286, words
3286, don't
3286, FIT
3286, you,'
3286, said
3286, the
3286, King,
3286, looking
3286, round
3286, the
3286, court
3287, with
3287, a
3287, smile.
3287, There
3287, was
3287, a
3287, dead
3287, silence.
3288, 
3289, 'It's
3289, a
3289, pun!'
3289, the
3289, King
3289, added
3289, in
3289, an
3289, offended
3289, tone,
3289, and
3289, everybody
3289, laughed,
3290, 'Let
3290, the
3290, jury
3290, consider
3290, their
3290, verdict,'
3290, the
3290, King
3290, said,
3290, for
3290, about
3290, the
3291, twentieth
3291, time
3291, that
3291, day.
3292, 
3293, 'No,
3293, no!'
3293, said
3293, the
3293, Queen.
3293, 'Sentence
3293, first--verdict
3293, afterwards.'
3294, 
3295, 'Stuff
3295, and
3295, nonsense!'
3295, said
3295, Alice
3295, loudly.
3295, 'The
3295, idea
3295, of
3295, having
3295, the
3296, sentence
3296, first!'
3297, 
3298, 'Hold
3298, your
3298, tongue!'
3298, said
3298, the
3298, Queen,
3298, turning
3298, purple.
3299, 
3300, 'I
3300, won't!'
3300, said
3300, Alice.
3301, 
3302, 'Off
3302, with
3302, her
3302, head!'
3302, the
3302, Queen
3302, shouted
3302, at
3302, the
3302, top
3302, of
3302, her
3302, voice.
3302, Nobody
3303, moved.
3304, 
3305, 'Who
3305, cares
3305, for
3305, you?'
3305, said
3305, Alice,
3305, (she
3305, had
3305, grown
3305, to
3305, her
3305, full
3305, size
3305, by
3305, this
3306, time.)
3306, 'You're
3306, nothing
3306, but
3306, a
3306, pack
3306, of
3306, cards!'
3307, 
3308, At
3308, this
3308, the
3308, whole
3308, pack
3308, rose
3308, up
3308, into
3308, the
3308, air,
3308, and
3308, came
3308, flying
3308, down
3308, upon
3309, her:
3309, she
3309, gave
3309, a
3309, little
3309, scream,
3309, half
3309, of
3309, fright
3309, and
3309, half
3309, of
3309, anger,
3309, and
3310, tried
3310, to
3310, beat
3310, them
3310, off,
3310, and
3310, found
3310, herself
3310, lying
3310, on
3310, the
3310, bank,
3310, with
3310, her
3311, head
3311, in
3311, the
3311, lap
3311, of
3311, her
3311, sister,
3311, who
3311, was
3311, gently
3311, brushing
3311, away
3311, some
3311, dead
3312, leaves
3312, that
3312, had
3312, fluttered
3312, down
3312, from
3312, the
3312, trees
3312, upon
3312, her
3312, face.
3313, 
3314, 'Wake
3314, up,
3314, Alice
3314, dear!'
3314, said
3314, her
3314, sister;
3314, 'Why,
3314, what
3314, a
3314, long
3314, sleep
3314, you've
3315, had!'
3316, 
3317, 'Oh,
3317, I've
3317, had
3317, such
3317, a
3317, curious
3317, dream!'
3317, said
3317, Alice,
3317, and
3317, she
3317, told
3317, her
3318, sister,
3318, as
3318, well
3318, as
3318, she
3318, could
3318, remember
3318, them,
3318, all
3318, these
3318, strange
3318, Adventures
3319, of
3319, hers
3319, that
3319, you
3319, have
3319, just
3319, been
3319, reading
3319, about;
3319, and
3319, when
3319, she
3319, had
3320, finished,
3320, her
3320, sister
3320, kissed
3320, her,
3320, and
3320, said,
3320, 'It
3320, WAS
3320, a
3320, curious
3320, dream,
3321, dear,
3321, certainly:
3321, but
3321, now
3321, run
3321, in
3321, to
3321, your
3321, tea;
3321, it's
3321, getting
3321, late.'
3321, So
3322, Alice
3322, got
3322, up
3322, and
3322, ran
3322, off,
3322, thinking
3322, while
3322, she
3322, ran,
3322, as
3322, well
3322, she
3322, might,
3323, what
3323, a
3323, wonderful
3323, dream
3323, it
3323, had
3323, been.
3324, 
3325, But
3325, her
3325, sister
3325, sat
3325, still
3325, just
3325, as
3325, she
3325, left
3325, her,
3325, leaning
3325, her
3325, head
3325, on
3325, her
3326, hand,
3326, watching
3326, the
3326, setting
3326, sun,
3326, and
3326, thinking
3326, of
3326, little
3326, Alice
3326, and
3326, all
3326, her
3327, wonderful
3327, Adventures,
3327, till
3327, she
3327, too
3327, began
3327, dreaming
3327, after
3327, a
3327, fashion,
3327, and
3328, this
3328, was
3328, her
3328, dream:--
3329, 
3330, First,
3330, she
3330, dreamed
3330, of
3330, little
3330, Alice
3330, herself,
3330, and
3330, once
3330, again
3330, the
3330, tiny
3331, hands
3331, were
3331, clasped
3331, upon
3331, her
3331, knee,
3331, and
3331, the
3331, bright
3331, eager
3331, eyes
3331, were
3331, looking
3332, up
3332, into
3332, hers--she
3332, could
3332, hear
3332, the
3332, very
3332, tones
3332, of
3332, her
3332, voice,
3332, and
3332, see
3332, that
3333, queer
3333, little
3333, toss
3333, of
3333, her
3333, head
3333, to
3333, keep
3333, back
3333, the
3333, wandering
3333, hair
3333, that
3334, WOULD
3334, always
3334, get
3334, into
3334, her
3334, eyes--and
3334, still
3334, as
3334, she
3334, listened,
3334, or
3334, seemed
3334, to
3335, listen,
3335, the
3335, whole
3335, place
3335, around
3335, her
3335, became
3335, alive
3335, the
3335, strange
3335, creatures
3335, of
3336, her
3336, little
3336, sister's
3336, dream.
3337, 
3338, The
3338, long
3338, grass
3338, rustled
3338, at
3338, her
3338, feet
3338, as
3338, the
3338, White
3338, Rabbit
3338, hurried
3338, by--the
3339, frightened
3339, Mouse
3339, splashed
3339, his
3339, way
3339, through
3339, the
3339, neighbouring
3339, pool--she
3340, could
3340, hear
3340, the
3340, rattle
3340, of
3340, the
3340, teacups
3340, as
3340, the
3340, March
3340, Hare
3340, and
3340, his
3340, friends
3341, shared
3341, their
3341, never-ending
3341, meal,
3341, and
3341, the
3341, shrill
3341, voice
3341, of
3341, the
3341, Queen
3342, ordering
3342, off
3342, her
3342, unfortunate
3342, guests
3342, to
3342, execution--once
3342, more
3342, the
3342, pig-baby
3343, was
3343, sneezing
3343, on
3343, the
3343, Duchess's
3343, knee,
3343, while
3343, plates
3343, and
3343, dishes
3343, crashed
3344, around
3344, it--once
3344, more
3344, the
3344, shriek
3344, of
3344, the
3344, Gryphon,
3344, the
3344, squeaking
3344, of
3344, the
3345, Lizard's
3345, slate-pencil,
3345, and
3345, the
3345, choking
3345, of
3345, the
3345, suppressed
3345, guinea-pigs,
3346, filled
3346, the
3346, air,
3346, mixed
3346, up
3346, with
3346, the
3346, distant
3346, sobs
3346, of
3346, the
3346, miserable
3346, Mock
3347, Turtle.
3348, 
3349, So
3349, she
3349, sat
3349, on,
3349, with
3349, closed
3349, eyes,
3349, and
3349, half
3349, believed
3349, herself
3349, in
3350, Wonderland,
3350, though
3350, she
3350, knew
3350, she
3350, had
3350, but
3350, to
3350, open
3350, them
3350, again,
3350, and
3350, all
3351, would
3351, change
3351, to
3351, dull
3351, reality--the
3351, grass
3351, would
3351, be
3351, only
3351, rustling
3351, in
3351, the
3352, wind,
3352, and
3352, the
3352, pool
3352, rippling
3352, to
3352, the
3352, waving
3352, of
3352, the
3352, reeds--the
3352, rattling
3353, teacups
3353, would
3353, change
3353, to
3353, tinkling
3353, sheep-bells,
3353, and
3353, the
3353, Queen's
3353, shrill
3354, cries
3354, to
3354, the
3354, voice
3354, of
3354, the
3354, shepherd
3354, boy--and
3354, the
3354, sneeze
3354, of
3354, the
3354, baby,
3354, the

3361, be
3361, herself
3361, a

3361, and
3361, how
3361, she
3361, would
3362, keep,
3362, through

3362, loving
3362, heart
3362, of

3363, and

3363, gather
3363, about

3363, other
3363, little
3363, children,
3363, and
3364, make
3364, THEIR
3364, eyes
3364, bright
3364, and
3364, eager
3364, with
3364, many
3364, a
3364, strange
3364, tale,
3364, perhaps
3364, even
3365, with
3365, the
3365, dream
3365, of
3365, Wonderland
3365, of
3365, long
3365, ago:
3365, and
3365, how
3365, she
3365, would
3365, feel
3365, with
3366, all
3366, their
3366, simple
3366, sorrows,
3366, and
3366, find
3366, a
3366, pleasure
3366, in
3366, all
