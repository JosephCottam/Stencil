* Verify that only names that appear in the tuples are used in the arguments.

* Named value (e.g. runtime constants)
	-> Some way to set values that can be referenced from rules
	-> Set at stencil compile time
	-> May be taken in as an argument to the stencil compiler
	
* Separate static and dynamic binding rules.
	-> Static rule runs the first time, dynamic rule thereafter
