Remove the stream requirements from explore and pull them into Stencil by adding a specializer clause to the "stream" declaration.


stream flowers(sepalLen, petalLen, obs) 
	from File["./dla;kj"]

stream tests(id, platform, pass, fail)
   from DB["./..."]

stream mouse(X,Y) from Mouse


Implementation:
  A specializer field #prototype is added that captures the prototype.
  The stream source must return tuples with that prototype (in that order).
  Exactly how they do it is implementation specific (for example, file
     streams may just assume it is correct if arity is correct but mouse
     may select a subset of the possible fields and repack them).
  Stream init occurs by default, but the stencil compiler takes a 
     dictionary of name/stream-source pairs to do override of any 
     stream definition that occurs in the dictionary.  Passed stream
     sources MUST have matching prototypes to the ones defined in the
     declaration.
