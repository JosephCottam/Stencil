Pens and "sigil types"

@gradient(@color(RED), @color(BLUE))			//Gradient from red to blue
@gradient(@color(RED), @color(BLUE), .95)		//Gradient from red to blue, but only covering 95% of the distance (solid red/blue on the last 2.5% each end)
@gradient(@color(RED), @color(BLUE), .25, true) //Repeating gradient, will repeat 4 times over the course
@gradient(@color(RED), @color(BLUE), 20, true)	//Repeating gradient, will repeat ever 20 pixels


This could work for both pens and fills
Would make patterns a type of sigil as well

@pattern(Hatch, 3, @color(Green))
@pattern(Solid, @color(blue))
@pattern(Paisely) 


Is there a difference between a stroke and a fill?  Maybe.  Look at these:
//dot means plot solid in default color, space means leave blank.  3px on 3px off
@stroke("...   ...   ...") 		

//Named pattern, should be the same as above
@stroke(DASH, 3, 3)

//Two-phase stroke.  Top half and bottom half (can build as many layers as desired)
@stroke("...   ...   ...", ".   ...   ...   ..")

//1 means color from 1st argument, 2 from 2nd argument, 3 from 3rd...
@stroke(@color(RED), @color(BLUE), @color(GREEN), "111   222   333")
