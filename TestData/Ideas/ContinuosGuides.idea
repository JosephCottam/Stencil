Different sample strategies for double, int and sigils
	--> Sigils need to provide a sample strategy operation

Force guide to certain bounds?
	-> Provide min/max as arguments to guide specializer
	-> Error in op if an input exceeds the bounds
	
Different types of operators: 
	Categorical guides only needed to know that something was categorical or not, continuous guides need more
	Sampling means that some values of the guide are not present in the input, as such some guide mappings are not as simple...
		Adding a reverse facet solves the problem sometimes
		
What do you do with summarizing operations (like max[1..n])?
	Have a special guide facet?  This multiplies facets on operators, complicating the interface.
		--> Could cascade them use guide then query then map
		Ability to specify special guide target
