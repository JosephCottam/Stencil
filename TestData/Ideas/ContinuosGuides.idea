Move some of the argumens from the axis specializer to the operator specializer when the operator is constructed
	* tickCount
	* sample
	* sampleBy
	
Move guide update to paint loop instead of data load loop.

Different sample strategies for double, int and sigils
	--> Sigils need to provide a sample strategy operation

Force guide to certain bounds?
	-> Provide min/max as arguments to guide specializer
	-> Error in op if an input exceeds the bounds
