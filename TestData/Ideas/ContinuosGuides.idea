* Guide declaration is tagged with a type attribute: Categorical, linear, log, exp
	--> Tick count determines sample count -or- 'every' determines sample interval (only valid on non-categorical)
* Ensure guide op cares about what type of guide is requested
* Continuos guide procedure:
	* Op records min/max of input from start or from the #->
	* Op knows sample strategy
	* On guide, op constructs sample points.  Different sample point creation for double, int and sigils
			--> Sigils need to provide a sample strategy operation

			
NOTES:
	*Force guide to certain bounds?
		-> Error in op if an input exceeds the bounds
