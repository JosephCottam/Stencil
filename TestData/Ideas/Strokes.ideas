Stroke as a "sigil type"

//dot means plot solid in default color, space means leave blank.  3px on 3px off
@stroke("...   ...   ...") 		

//Named pattern, should be the same as above
@stroke(DASH, 3, 3)

//Two-phase stroke.  Top half and bottom half (can build as many layers as desired)
@stroke("...   ...   ...", ".   ...   ...   ..")

//1 means color from 1st argument, 2 from 2nd argument, 3 from 3rd...
@stroke(@color(RED), @color(BLUE), @color(GREEN), "111   222   333")
