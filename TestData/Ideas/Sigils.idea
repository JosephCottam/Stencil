How to improve sigils:

Sigil has its own grammar, but provide a standard splitter (same syntax as specializers that don't do split or range).
Entire text block is passed to sigil with an environment.
Unquote-values are denoted with an @ inside the sigil.  @@ may be sigil value from the environment?
