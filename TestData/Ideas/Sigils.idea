How can I make sigils work:

Standard parser captures the @<name>(<args>*) as a single node
Sigils are imported from modules
Sigil parser dispatches based on the name to special parsers
Sigil types associate with one or more external data types
Sigils rely on the sub-tuple features to be useful


All sigil types:
1) Implement tuple
2) Have a from-tree constructor or factory method (not sure which)
3) Have a externalize method to convert to a more efficient external representation
4) Have an internalize method to take the external representation and convert it to the sigil type


Externalize is used to convert the sigil type to a more standard java object (if required).  
May be used for types that cannot be extended or whose external representation depends on values
of the tuple.

Interalize is used by Tuples.convert to convert from an external type to the sigil type.
