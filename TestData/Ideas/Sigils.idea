Sigils parsers needed:
	* Pens
		* Color     (done)
		* Gradient
		* Stroke
		* Fill
	* Date
	* Font/Text formats
	* Math

A sigil is an alternative grammar environment.  A tuple-reference syntax is supplied.  Stencil parses the tuple-references and does textual substations (but nothing else).  The operator is responsible for completing the parse on the resulting text.
