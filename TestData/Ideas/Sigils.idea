How to improve sigils:

Sigil has its own grammar, but provide a standard splitter (same syntax as specializers that don't do split or range).
Entire text block is passed to sigil with an environment.
Unquote-values are denoted with an @ inside the sigil.  @@ may be sigil value from the environment?


Sigils needed:
	* Pens
		* Color
		* Gradient
		* Stroke
		* Fill
	* Date
	* Font/Text formats
	
After color, fill and Font are sigils, then then glyphs are simpler tuples (since all these attributes are sub-tuples).  
	--> Will need the ability to assign to sub-tuples in targets (might be able to already...hopefully)
