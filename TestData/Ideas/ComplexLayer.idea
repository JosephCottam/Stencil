That's about it, for the outsides...on the inside:

Layer type voronoi provides the mathematics for computing a Voronoi diagram.
The glyph iterator returns a set of Voronoi cells.  
Each cell is not shape-controlled by Stencil programs, but the layer does the complex computation.

This is a similar mechanism that could work for stacked graphs as well...
