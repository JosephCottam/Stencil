Some data is static…and some algorithms are better viewed as tables anyway (layouts, Voronoi cells).  Provide a table type for Stencil that is like a layer, but is not rendered. The system "knows" about about tables and can use them intelligently (e.g., share columns with them).


table ZipCodes["Dict"]
from Zips
   (Zip, X,Y,City,State) : (Zip,X,Y,City, State)
   Order: Zip

layer scribble
from ZipCodes
  group: State
  Order: Zip
  (X,Y) : (X,Y)
  Color: Coloring(State)

//This would only store the information once, but use it for both the table and the layer.



table Cells["Voronoi"]
from Places
  (ID,X,Y) : (ID,X,Y)

//Type Voronoi determines that X,Y and ID are settable, but returns point-sets under ID, and points…
