Some data is staticÉand some algorithms are better viewed as tables anyway (layouts, Voronoi cells).  Provide a table type for Stencil that is like a layer, but is not rendered. The system "knows" about about tables and can use them intelligently (e.g., share columns with them).


table ZipCodes["Dict"]
from Zips
   (Zip, X,Y,City,State) : (Zip,X,Y,City, State)
   Order: Zip

layer scribble
from ZipCodes
  group: State
  Order: Zip
  (X,Y) : (X,Y)
  Color: Coloring(State)

//This would only store the information once, but use it for both the table and the layer.

Osciliscope using table and a sampling strategy....
import Time

stream data(v) from Text["StdIn"]

table subset[sample:"newest", size:1000]
from data
  v : v
  time: Now() -> [Min] Range[ALL](v, @Min) -> Sub(Now,Min)

layer scope["polyline"]
from subset
  ID: Count()
  X:* Scale[0,100](time)
  Y: Scale[0,100](v)
