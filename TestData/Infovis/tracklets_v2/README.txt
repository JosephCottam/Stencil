These are the version 2 tracklets updated as of March 22, 2008.  All new
work should use this tracklet data as it is more complete than the version
1 data.

WHY?

The version 1 tracklets did not correctly record transitions between the eights
and seventh floors.  There are no sensors in the stairwells so occupants
transiting between floors got lost.  The new dataset attempts to correct
the problem with blind spots to give a better picture of the true structure.

The version 1 tracklets are retained in the tracklets_v1 directory to allow
validation of older results obtained from the version 1 data.
