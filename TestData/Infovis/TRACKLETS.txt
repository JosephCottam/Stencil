TRACKELTS If a "track" is an uninterrupted chain of sensor activations representingthe progress of someone from one part of the space to another, then"tracklets" are little bits of those tracks, punctuated by ambiguities, anda "tracklet graph" is a collection of those tracklets that are linkedtogether by ambiguities.  The "true" track of an individual may beidentical to one of the tracklets, if that track does not venture near anyother moving person in the space.  More likely, if the individual crossespaths with someone else, then that "true" track will be broken intosuccession of smaller tracklets chained together by joints, and linkedby those joints also into a larger graph containing other tracklets.  Theresult is a graph that represents all the possible explanations of theambiguous labelings of the tracklets into complete possible tracks. Note that in the dataset there are many such graphs. Each graph contains the minimal set of related tracklets that cannot be unambiguously separated.  For example if person 1 walks from a to b and interacts with no one, thenthere should be a single tracklet beginning at a and ending at b. If person 1 crosses paths with person 2 who is walking from C to D,then there may be a tracklet graph like this: a -> j1c -> j1j1 -> j2 j2 -> Bj2 -> Drendered like this:   a       |      |   c    \ /      j1     |      |      j2    / \    |  |    |  |    B  |          D     This graph is ambiguous.  It might mean "p1 went from a to B and p2 wentfrom c to D, and along the way they walked together from j1 to j2".  Itmight also mean "p1 went from a to D and p2 went from c to B, and along theway they walked together from j1 to j2".  Note that it might *also* mean "Acouple of people left together from a and some different small group leftfrom c, they joined into larger group while walking from j1 to j2, and then*some* of the first group went to D while the rest went to B, while all of thesecond group went to B."  Or any other combination thereof.REPRESENTATIONThe graph data is contained in three tables:  o motionsensors_tracklets2    o motionsensors_master2tracklet o motionsensors_tracklets2_jointsmotionsensors_tracklets2     This table defines a track as a begin sensor_ID and time, and an end  sensor_ID and time, and assigns a unique track_ID to each track.  table description is in motionsensors_tracklets2.sql  and the data is contained in these files:    tracklets_v2/tracklets_0114.txt    tracklets_v2/tracklets_0115.txt    tracklets_v2/tracklets_0116.txt    tracklets_v2/tracklets_0117.txt    tracklets_v2/tracklets_0118.txt o motionsensors_tracklets2_joints    This table contains at least one entry for each joint mapping one tracklet  id (id_from) to another (id_to).  If a search for a tracklet ID in the  id_to field returns many results, then we say that is a "merge": several  tracklets ambiguously have this tracklet as a continuation, as in j1  above.  Similarly, if a search for a tracklet ID in the id_from field  results in many hits, then we say that is a "split": that tracklet  has several possible continuations.    If a search for a tracklet ID in the id_to field returns no results, then  that is called a "begin" of a track since the tracklet springs from nothing.  Similarly no results for an id_from search means that the tracklet is an  "end"  of a track since it terminates any track: there is no continuation.  table description is in motionsensors_tracklets2_joints.sql  and the data is contained in these files:    tracklets_v2/joints_0114.txt    tracklets_v2/joints_0115.txt    tracklets_v2joints_0116.txt    tracklets_v2/joints_0117.txt    tracklets_v2/joints_0118.txt o motionsensors_master2tracklet  This table associates each motion activation in motionsensors_master with  its track.  We know from motionsensors_tracklets2 that track 3 starts at  sensor 393 and ends at sensor 360.  This table tells us that the complete  sequence of activations defining this track was 393, 385, 387, 363, 387,  360, 359, 360, 359, 360.  table description is in motionsensors_master2trackleot.sql  and the data is contained in these files:    tracklets_v2/master2track_0114.txt    tracklets_v2/master2track_0115.txt    tracklets_v2/master2track_0116.txt    tracklets_v2/master2track_0117.txt    tracklets_v2/master2track_0118.txtQUERIESWhen performing queries on the data, it is important not to confusesensor_id's with tracklet_id's or joint_id's.  They are all distinct.To find a tracklet beginning at a particular sensor:SELECT *   FROM motionsensors_tracklets2   WHERE start_id = 277   ORDER BY start_timeOne result is tracklet_id = 65.  To find all the tracklets that mightcontinue that tracklet: Select id_to   FROM motionsensors_tracklets2_joints  WHERE id_from = 65   ORDER BY id_fromThis tells us that tracklets 66 and 67 are possible continuations.Continuing the process shows that these both lead to ends, there are nocontinuations of these tracklets, that is, there are no results from thequery:SELECT id_to   FROM motionsensors_tracklets2_joints  WHERE id_from IN ( 66 , 67 )  ORDER BY id_fromSimilarly to find what tracklets came before 65: SELECT id_from  FROM motionsensors_tracklets2_joints  WHERE id_to = 65   ORDER BY id_fromThis query generates no results, so this is a complete (but small)_tracklet graph: begin at 227, tracklet 65 to sensor 280, then a split, withone leg leading to tracklet 66 loitering at sensor 277 while tracklet 67leads away, terminating at sensor 283.In this example tracklet 66 is only 1 second long, and is probably anartifact of the tracklet generating process.Version 2 Tracklets vs. Version 1 TrackletsThe version 1 tracklets did not correctly record transitions between the eightsand seventh floors.  There are no sensors in the stairwells so occupantstransiting between floors got lost.  The new dataset attempts to correctthe problem with blind spots to give a better picture of the true structure.The new tracklet data resides in the directory tracklets_v2.The old tracklet data resides in the directory archive/tracklets_v1.The version 1 tracklets are obsolete.  They are only retained so thatpeople who downloaded the WMD dataset before March 22, 2008 can retainaccess to exactly the same data they used before, and so that new peoplecan exactly replicate the results of older papers.IMPORTANT!  1) All new work should use the data in the the tracklets_v2 directory. 2) tracklet_id's are NOT consistent across the v1 and v2 datasets.
