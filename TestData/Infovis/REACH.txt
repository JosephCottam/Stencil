This file presumes understanding of TRACKLETS.txt.We define sensor reach from sensoor A to sensor B to be 1 if there is atracklet graph that contains a plausible trip starting at sensor A andending at sesor B.For example this tracklet graph:     a   c     |   |     |   j3     |  / \     | /   |     j1    E     |      j2    / \    |  |    |  |    B  |          Dcontains these plausible paths:a -> B a -> D c -> B c -> D e -> E which would generate entries like this: start_id end_id start_time end_time a        B      T_aB_start T_aB_enda        D      T_aD_start T_aD_endc        B      T_cB_start T_cB_endc        D      T_cD_start T_cD_endc        E      T_cE_start T_cE_endNotice that there is no plausible path from a to E, so there is nocontribution by this graph to the notion that a can reach E.There was some discussion at the First Workshop on Massive Datasets aboutthe relative weights that should be assigned to these possible oucomes.One camp argues that all of the five possible partial interpretationsshould contribute equally to the estimate of reach.  Another camp arguesthat the complexity of the explaination about how a gets to B, possibly interms of the number of joins crossed or some other measure of graphcomplexity, should induce a non-uniform weighting.The sensor reach tables provided in this dataset use a uniform weightingapporach, so that the reach_count in the table is always equal to 1.To build estimates of the transition probability for the space one canaccumulate counts over a period of time.  For example, for all tripsstarting at sensor 462 on March 22, 2007 to count the destinations:     SELECT coalesce(sr.c, 0)     FROM (SELECT sensor_id FROM sensor_map ORDER BY sensor_id ) sids     LEFT JOIN (SELECT end_sensor_id, count(*) AS c FROM sensor_reach               WHERE start_sensor_id = 462                     AND start_time >= 1174536000000                      AND end_time <= 1174622400000               GROUP BY end_sensor_id ) sr     ON sids.sensor_id = sr.end_sensor_id     ORDER BY sids.sensor_id;This basic building block can be used to generate estimates of thetransition probabiltiy for the space: the probability that a trip startingat location a will end at location B.
