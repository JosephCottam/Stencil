The raw motion activations are in files broken up into mega-second chunks:  0114.txt.gz   Mar 21 23:00:25 2006 to Jun 11 00:26:40 2006  0115.txt.gz   Jun 11 00:26:40 2006 to Oct  4 18:13:20 2006  0116.txt.gz   Oct  4 18:13:20 2006 to Jan 28 11:00:00 2007  0117.txt.gz   Jan 28 11:00:00 2007 to May 24 05:46:40 2007  0118.txt.gz   May 24 05:46:40 2007 to Jul  2 15:41:50 2007  The files contain data like this:   470 01179980510828 01179980511853 1.0  469 01179980512169 01179980513193 1.0  467 01179980513580 01179980514609 1.0  468 01179980514573 01179980515598 1.0That means that there was an activation of sensor 470 starting at01179980510828 also known as Thursday May 24, 2007 at 00:21:50 and 828msand lasting until 1000ms later.  The magnitude of the activations as 1.0,as it will always be for raw motion activations.  That activation wasfollowed by an activation of sensor 469 after a pause of 1341 milliseconds,then 1411ms after that, sensor 467, then another 993ms later, sensor 468.This represents a person walking down one of the central pathways on theseventh floor and turning a corner, travelling about 1.6 meters per second.We store the data in a database tablecreated by the sql acript calledmotionsensors_master.sqlGiven such a table, loading the supplied data files is accpomplished withthis code (see the script motionsensors_master.sql):  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '0118.txt'   IGNORE INTO TABLE motionsensors_master       FIELDS TERMINATED BY ' ' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'       (`sensor_id`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `avg_mag`);The data should load into matlab directly:  load 0117.txt  plot(X0117(ii,2), X0117(ii,1), '.')  axis([1.1773E12 1.1779E12 250 510])This should result in a display of the week of April 23rd, 2006.The physical layout of the sensors is recorded in the file map.txt, wherethe first column is the sensor ID, and the other eight colums specifiy theview of the sensor as a quadrilateral, with coordinates expressed inmeters.  Rendering the sensors according to this map should produce animage similar to map.png.The files wings.txt logically groups the sensors into regions of thebuilding, including the floor.
