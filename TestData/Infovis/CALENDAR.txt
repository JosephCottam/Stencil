There are several files that detail calendar events within MERL:away.txt  Time away from MERL is typically (but not always) recorded in the company  calendar.  This fine is a list of days during the experimental period,  marked by timestamps in the first column) and the total number of  absences recorded in the calendar for that day (in the second column).  Holidays are marked by adding 100 to the away total.fire.txt    This is a list of timestamps of days during 2006 that are logged as  requiring a visit form the fire department to clear building alarms.  I'm  not sure that this list is complete, nor am I sure that all the listed  calls required an evacuation of MERL.  I do know that the April 20 call  required an evacuation that began at 12:54PM. The timestamps are noon in  the given day, but the time of day is unknown, the call log only  contains dates.	nitta.txt  This is a list of scheduled meetings in the Nitta Seminar room, labeled as  such on the map.  It is a large room.  The first column is the start time,  the second column is the end time.  There may be duplicates and overlaps  since there are two places to reserve times.  There is no guarantee that  meetings started or ended at the scheduled time, or took place at all.  Isolated meetings tend to start 5 minutes late or so, and usually do  happen.  Meetings that are part of a block of sequential meetings are  likely a single visitor, and the schedule often slips, and some meetings  may take place in lab spaces instead of the reserved meeting room.belady.txt  This is a list of scheduled meetings in the Belady Conference room, labeled  as "Belady conf."  on the map.  It is a small room.  Notes as above.8th.txt  This is a list of scheduled meetings in the 8th Floor North Conference  room, labeled as "8-North conf."  on the map.  It is a small room.  Notes  as above.7th.txt  This is a list of scheduled meetings in the 7th Floor North Conference  room, labeled as "7-North conf."  on the map.  It is a small room.  Notes  as above.lunch.txt  This is a list of scheduled meetings in the lunch room, labeled as such on  the map.  It is a medium sized room.  Notes as above.  In addition it is  worth noting that meetings scheduled for this room tend to be social in  nature.dst.txt  This is a list of the timezone changes during the experimental period.  The first and last lines show the time zone at the beginning and end of  the data.  The intermediate lines list the new timezone in effect at the  time listed.    The columns are: timestamp, year, month, day, hour, GMT offset.  I hate daylight savings time.
