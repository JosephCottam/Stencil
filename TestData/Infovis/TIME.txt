Timestamps are the number of milliseconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time, without includingleap seconds.  That is, 1000*time(); in C.for example:  $ date ; date +"%s" ; todate -d  Mon Jul  2 14:54:42 EDT 2007  1183402482  1183402482861Note that this number is greater than 2^32, so you must be careful to usea 64-bit integer representation in your code:  lang  type  ----  ----------  gcc   long long  msvc  __int64  java  BigInteger  perl  use bignum;
