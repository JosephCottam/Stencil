/** The ViewTuple is the interface to a view
 * of the canvas.  To be complete, an adapter
 * must provide appropriate view tuples to manipulate
 * their camera-like objects and transition between
 * application/screen, canvas and view coordinate spaces.
 *
 * ViewTuples do not set the width/height/X/Y of the panel,
 * rather they manipulate the zoom or pan levels displayed
 * in that panel.
 *
 * Due to graphics system constraints, the width and height may not
 * be independently set-able. For adapters where this is not
 * possible, it is suggested that ZOOM be supported instead
 * and WIDTH/HEIGHT throw exceptions.  Systems capable of setting
 * independent X and Y zoom distortions may handle ZOOM as they see
 * fit. See the adapter implementation for details of its implementation.
 *
 * View tuple also provide basic abilities to convert between
 * the view and the canvas coordinate system.
